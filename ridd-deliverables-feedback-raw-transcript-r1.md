    [00:01] The biggest theme looking through these is that the titles, descriptions, and highlights are all pretty significantly too verbose and actually just have too many characters in them.
    
    [00:19] I think they should all be reduced by as much as 40 to 50%.
    
    [00:30] The description hook, I think, is where I feel this the most.
    
    [00:35] It's written like the first paragraph of an essay, but I really just wanted to introduce the episode.
    
    [00:42] So I think almost every single time I would write half as much.
    
    [01:00] I do kinda like how that first sentence is really leaning into the hook piece.
    
    [01:21] I think the questions that it it's asking though are almost too specific.
    
    [01:28] For instance, for Gabe, it's what does it take to go from proving I can do this mode to confidently positioning yourself as a design cofounder as a service.
    
    [01:40] That's just too in the weeds out of the gate.
    
    [01:45] I might say something more applicable.
    
    [01:51] Like, what does it take to thrive as an independent designer.
    
    [02:22] Or what does it take to successfully make the jump and thrive in an independent design practice or something like that.
    
    [02:36] If you're too quickly narrow in, I think the hook becomes less interesting.
    
    [02:54] The same thing with Escha.
    
    [02:56] It says, what if I told you there's a designer at Perplexity who doesn't just create mock ups?
    
    [03:01] She generates three d planets for onboarding flows, collaborates with music producers to craft browser soundtracks, and trains her own AI models to create thousands of unique invite cards.
    
    [03:11] That sentence is interesting.
    
    [03:13] I like the idea behind it.
    
    [03:15] I could see it maybe showing up as the second or third sentence, but that's too in the weeds to grip people in the beginning.
    
    [03:49] I would say something closer to imagine joining perplexity as a designer.
    
    [04:00] And on your very first day, you're handed the keys to comment and asked to design an AI native browser from scratch.
    
    [04:18] That's a little bit more relatable because a person can picture what that might be like.
    
    [04:43] For the titles, it's kinda similar.
    
    [04:46] We're we're just getting really specific.
    
    [04:48] And the more specific you get, the less people that appeals to.
    
    [04:52] So how can you be compelling while still being applicable?
    
    [05:05] Like for Gabe, the main title is beyond the first 20, how to transition from scrambling freelancer to design cofounder as a service.
    
    [05:16] The phrase design cofounder as a service is very specific to Gabe.
    
    [05:21] The point of the episode is how to build an independent design practice and design co founder as a service is just one very specific flavor that Gabe went after as a niche.
    
    [05:40] So the title should say something about the future of fractional design or strategies for building an independent design practice.
    
    [06:00] The title I went with in this case was how to thrive as an independent designer.
    
    [06:08] And then one of the variant titles was the future belongs to fractional designers.
    
    [06:27] Contrast that with how to architect your creative practice with two year survival data and apprentice leverage.
    
    [06:39] That does not mean much.
    
    [06:41] And secondly, the alternative titles have to be concise because I'm using them as YouTube thumbnails.
    
    [06:52] So we should probably put a character limit.
    
    [06:59] Otherwise, it's not very helpful.
    
    [07:10] The character limit should probably be 45 characters.
    
    [07:43] Probably the most relevant title is Cat Smalls.
    
    [07:48] It says designers who build influence instead of just shipping pixels.
    
    [07:55] I like the simplicity of the language.
    
    [08:00] It doesn't have anything gripping about it, though.
    
    [08:14] So what I said was similar, but it's subtly different.
    
    [08:17] I said how staff designers build influence as ICs.
    
    [08:23] And that word how sparks a bit of curiosity.
    
    [08:29] It's not just a statement.
    
    [08:30] It's hinting at what you might learn.
    
    [08:33] So I don't wanna overuse it, but saying how blank or why blank is helpful in my opinion.
    
    [08:50] For reference, the sub variant title that I used was how to build influence as a designer.
    
    [08:58] It's much simpler.
    
    [09:00] And just to restate, these alternative titles are for YouTube, so they have to be very clear language that makes someone want to click on a thumbnail.
    
    [09:24] For Carl Rivera, the main title is the CDO who's building designer in confidence by breaking design systems.
    
    [09:33] Way too specific.
    
    [09:59] Instead, we did Shopify's big bet on design and craft as the differentiator.
    
    [10:08] And a variant title is crafting 10 of 10 experiences in the age of AI, which as a general note saying AI or vibe coding is always helpful for alternative titles.
    
    [10:36] And it's okay for the titles to only be subtly different too.
    
    [10:42] They don't always have to be three very distinct ideas.
    
    [11:02] For Carl's description hook, the question, what do you do when everyone becomes a seven out of 10 designer overnight is actually my favorite hook so far because, again, it's very relatable.
    
    [11:24] The rest of the description is just too long, so I would be very interested to see what the follow-up would be if it was only half as long.
    
    [11:36] And this applies to the description highlights too.
    
    [11:39] Like, I really like them to be on a single line.
    
    [11:47] So he says, why designers are the second most valuable talent in tech, parentheses, after AI researchers.
    
    [11:56] Just make it more succinct.
    
    [11:57] We don't need after AI researchers.
    
    [11:59] I want these to be much more concise.
    
    [12:21] Other than that, the actual format, like the beginning of the description highlights is quite good.
    
    [12:31] It definitely feels like how I would structure the sentence.
    
    [12:35] They just need to be shorter.
    
    [12:48] Like, another description example is with Kat Small.
    
    [12:53] It says why distribution is the most important part of the process and her specific tactics for making vision stick across teams.
    
    [13:04] Either one of those individual phrases would probably be pretty good, but it jammed together two ideas into something that feels like a full sentence rather than a bullet point.
    
    [13:21] As far as the newsletter titles go, they're actually really good, but I think I'd like to have three different versions shared so that I can pick just in case the first one isn't great.
    
    [13:58] For the newsletter subtitle, they're too long.
    
    [14:02] They need to be probably 60% as long, and they're not interesting enough.
    
    [14:19] The whole point of the subtitle is to use real estate to get someone to want to open up an email.
    
    [14:27] Honestly, the easiest way to do that is to take one of the main takeaways and turn that into the subtitle.
    
    [14:56] Or you can also write a compelling description of what someone can expect to get out of listening to the episode.
    
    [15:14] For cat small, the title was measuring sticks, and the subtitle was strategies for building influence, which, again, speaks to what you would hope to gain by listening.
    
    [15:38] For Sarah Vienna, the title was human truth, and the subtitle was an idea for using AI in research.
    
    [16:08] For the highlights or key takeaways, I think the content is pretty good, but the paragraphs themselves don't really feel like something I would write yet.
    
    [16:25] And they're also kind of hard to parse.
    
    [16:28] And so I think maybe what would be more helpful is actually if the initial output was just a bullet point list of the key ideas within a given takeaway, including any relevant quotes that are included too.
    
    [16:50] So that way I can just skim the bullet point list and say, yeah.
    
    [16:55] This makes sense, or this one isn't very interesting.
    
    [17:00] Whereas right now, I feel like I have to actually read a mini essay to even figure out if it's interesting or not, where I'm mostly viewing these as doors.
    
    [17:13] Just show me which doors and give me an idea of what's behind them, and then I'll pick which doors that I wanna go down.
    
    [17:18] And the process of actually drafting what is included in those doors would happen a little bit later in the process of working with Claude.
    
    [17:38] For this reason, I think I definitely want at least four and up to six different takeaways for each episode.
