### Description Hook

One of the most impressive things I've seen in design leadership is when someone's ideas travel without them having to be in the room. Catt Small, author of "Staff Designer," has systematically cracked the code on building this kind of influence—and I'm willing to bet that you haven't thought about it this strategically. After studying her approach to relationship mapping, energy audits, and vision creation, I realized most designers are operating with a completely backward understanding of what creates lasting career momentum.

### Key Takeaways

## 3 highlights from my interview with Catt

**1 — Your ideas traveling without you is the ultimate measure of influence**

Most designers think influence means being in more meetings or having a fancy title. But Catt revealed a much more sophisticated way to measure your actual impact: whether your ideas travel without you. She explained how social capital works like a currency—the more you have, the more vulnerable you can be with sharing ideas and the better people respond to them. The clearest signal? When someone mentions an idea you shared with them to another person, and that person comes back to you asking for more details.

> "Your ideas travel without you having to be the person saying them. Social capital is essentially the currency of your relationships."

— Catt Small

This happens through frameworks, illustrations, and storytelling that makes your concepts "meme-able"—concise enough for others to deliver on your behalf. It's not about being the loudest voice in the room; it's about creating ideas that are so clear and compelling that they spread naturally through your organization.

**2 — The energy audit reveals what's actually blocking your promotion**

Catt coined her approach around identifying "glue work"—the important but often invisible work that fills organizational gaps. While improving team culture and onboarding processes matters, she realized these activities weren't what got staff designers promoted. The key question she now asks herself: "Does it have to be me, or actually should somebody else be doing that?" This led to her systematic energy audit, where she identified what she wanted to be known for versus what just needed to get done.

> "I was doing a lot of glue work and that was a big part of why I just didn't have the capacity to invest in some of the things that my manager and her manager were saying that they needed to see from me to get to that next level."

— Catt Small

The result? She refocused on creating visions, building stakeholder relationships, and developing the strategic thinking that actually defined the staff designer role. Sometimes being helpful in every area prevents you from being exceptional in the areas that matter most for your career progression.

**3 — Vision distribution determines long-term impact more than the vision itself**

Most designers think the work ends when they finish creating the vision. Catt learned this was backwards—distribution is actually the most critical phase. She developed a systematic approach: presenting in all-hands meetings, scheduling follow-ups with stakeholders who contributed ideas, recording video walkthroughs for broader access, and embedding the vision in multiple relevant documents. The proof of success? Features from her Asana goal management vision were still shipping a full year after she left the company.

> "Distribution is the most important part of the process. If you don't share the work, nobody knows it happened."

— Catt Small

Her approach treats vision distribution like a product launch—multiple touchpoints, various formats for different audiences, and ongoing reinforcement. The goal isn't just buy-in; it's creating a reference point that teams continue using to guide decisions long after the initial presentation. When your vision becomes part of the company's planning vocabulary, you've achieved true influence.
