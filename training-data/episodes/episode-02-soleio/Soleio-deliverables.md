### 3 key ideas from Soleio

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Coding was a red herring**
There used to be a holy war over whether or not designers should spend time and energy learning how to code.

But it turns out coding was a little bit of a red herring. Instead Soleio segments designers into two buckets:

Designers who can ship real product

Designers who create concept cars and blueprints

If that makes you uncomfortable or sparks a bit of conviction‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm right there with ya üòÖ but the fact is that tools like Cursor and Claude (remember, Joel ?) have lowered the bar to the point where we no longer have any excuse.

> ‚ÄúDesigners who are not shipping are running out of excuses‚Äù
> 
- Soleio

Here‚Äôs the thing though‚Ä¶ if anyone can create software then design will become an even greater differentiator. And I‚Äôm feeling incredibly grateful to bring design as a core skill into the future.

At Facebook in the early days they used to have a saying: ‚Äúthe quick shall inherit the earth‚Äù. Well there‚Äôs nobody faster than a designer who can ship.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Ideal traits for founding designers**
I‚Äôm as biased as it gets, but I firmly believe that the founding designer role is the most exciting job opportunity in all of tech. And Soleio is always helping his portfolio companies find their first designers ( like this one ).

So I asked him‚Ä¶ what makes for a successful founding designer?

First off you need to be generative . You don‚Äôt fall in love with your work because you‚Äôre producing so much of it. That means you have to be quick to throw away ideas.

Designing at a successful startup is like building sandcastles. You‚Äôre constantly shipping and experimenting while letting a lot of work get washed away.

> ‚ÄúYou need a mental openness to not just focus on your solution but the broader problem space that‚Äôs sitting in the periphery‚Äù
> 
- Soleio

He used a metaphor from the book Pattern Breakers (which he strongly recommended multiple times):

Maybe you start off selling Happy Meals but after a while you realize that what people really want are the toys. Founding designers need to be willing to walk away from the kitchen and become a toy maker.

3Ô∏è‚É£ How startups can strategically attack incumbents
In order to gain ground against an incumbent, startups need to attack them along a vector that challenges a core assumption or business model . Hamilton Helmer refers to this as ‚Äúcounter-positioning‚Äù in his book 7 Powers :

> ‚ÄúA newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent does not mimic due to anticipated damage to their existing business‚Äù
> 
- Hamilton Helmer

Take Perplexity for example (remember Henry?).

A few years ago you‚Äôd get laughed at for going head to head with Google search.

But it turns out those 10 blue links on page 1 are nothing more than an unnecessary door in a hallway. Remove the door and you wonder why it ever existed in the first place.

Except‚Ä¶ Google can‚Äôt remove the door. Because it‚Äôs the cash cow that funds every other business.

In the interview, Soleio talks about how the same dynamic happened at Facebook.

Once Snapchat started showing significant traction it highlighted that many people didn‚Äôt want an internet written in ink. And yet, Facebook was heavily investing in an endlessly scrolling page that showcased a permanent record of who you were.

> ‚Äú‚Ä¶it works against the inertia of the company and how they view what people want‚Äù
> 
- Soleio

If you want to go deeper on this topic there‚Äôs a fantastic article by Packy McCormick called ‚Äú The Unbearable Heaviness of Being Positioned ‚Äù.

### Ridd‚Äôs Brain dump

 I think the titles are great. I'm always tempted to use things like the new era, but it's easy to do that too much. But even the secondary title, where it talks about the rise of designers who ship or becoming a designer who ships, it speaks to the transformation. And that's what people are here listening to achieve. They want to grow. They want to get better. They want to have some kind of a transformation professionally. And so anytime that the title can lend itself to that, I think that's a win. I think the hook is just fine. It's a little bit unique because it's one of the only repeat guests, so this format isn't super applicable to other episodes. The highlights are strong. "Little traits" as a leading phrase makes a lot of sense because again, you want to know what that list is. I also like what you can do to invest in your future founder journey today, hints at there being very practical takeaways inside of the episode. And then the why we won't use smartphones the same way five years from now is also really effective because everybody always likes futuristic predictions too. The title for the newsletter is very good. It's one of my favorites actually because it's super ambiguous. You don't know what it's about. But then when you read the takeaway, you realize that it is pulling out a phrase that was used in the takeaway. So the title of the takeaway is "Coding Was a Red Herring" and so you don't understand what the title means for the newsletter until you get to that takeaway and then it clicks. And I love creating that. Anytime there's a unique or kind of quirky phrase from one of the takeaways that I can then turn into the subject line, I always try to do that. The key takeaway is really strong too because it leads with a belief that is well understood and then says why it was wrong. And that's always going to be a winning formula when you can say something that is a bit counterintuitive.
