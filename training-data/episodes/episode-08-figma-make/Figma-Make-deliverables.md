### Description Hook

wtf is a prototype now??

we've made incremental progress for a decade+ and then everything changed overnight 😳

So this week is all about the future of prototyping because we get to hear from [Holly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hollyli2018/?utm_source=dive-club.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=wtf-is-a-prototype&_bhlid=aed795b2f57c44ef0eb7024a55369b02f93a740f) and [Nikolas](https://x.com/nikolasklein?utm_source=dive-club.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=wtf-is-a-prototype&_bhlid=805d74d6a8246fde40c9ab1f408951078fb7cefa) from the [Figma Make](https://www.figma.com/make/?utm_source=dive-club.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=wtf-is-a-prototype&_bhlid=b4d7d0b540c68b625e0b358197c20749e77c4bea) team.

### Key Takeaways

**1 — Time to rethink fidelity**

When you hear “low fidelity,” you probably think gray boxes and wireframes. It’s become shorthand for *visual* roughness.

But fidelity isn’t just about visuals… it lives on multiple axes.

Holly shared how she’ll sometimes *intentionally* ask Figma Make for a wireframe with gray boxes. That way, she can focus entirely on the interaction design.

> *“I just want to figure out what this interaction is going to look like. And then once I've validated that it works in code and that it feels good for me to use…then I will go and actually figure out the design specifics”*
> 
- Holly Li

This example really resonates with me because prototyping with AI has improved my interaction design more than just about anything else. You don’t need the skills or even the right language to make something happen.

Niko joked that you can tell the AI to “make it feel like a bouncy ball on a rainy day” and it’s true! You might not know what that looks like but *something* will happen and you can easily iterate from there.

Which brings me to my next point 👇

**2 — Embrace “meta prototyping”**
You ever see people like Jhey building these little sliders that allow you to tweak values and explore interactions live?

I used to think that was only something design engineers at Vercel could pull off but now you can add this to your prototype with a single prompt.

Just tell the AI what variables you want to mess with and it’ll generate the sliders for you automatically.

We started calling this “meta prototyping,” and it genuinely unlocks a new ceiling for what you can build .

One thing I like to do is ask the AI to create a custom Inspect tab for developers.

For example, when I was working on theming logic for Inflight , I had AI generate documentation and give my engineer a one-click way to copy my custom gradients.

So returning back to the “bouncy ball on a rainy day” interaction…

You could easily ask AI to:

Create sliders to tweak the animation

Outline the full code and logic for your developer to use

Pretty cool, right?

**3 — Code is glue**
The final state for software will always be code.

So the more people who can work directly in that medium, the better the collaboration gets.

Remember when Gunnar Gray talked about designing the shader animation for Perplexity’s voice mode ?

If he had stayed in After Effects, it would’ve been much harder for the engineer to realize his vision.

This isn’t about designers doing everyone’s jobs. It’s about contributing to a shared set of artifacts.

“AI and code is the glue that might bring us closer together rather than create this like unicorn designer who's now doing everything by themselves”

Niko Klein
When the output is standardized, you can insert yourself wherever you’re strongest or most curious.

For Gunnar, that meant shaders.

For me… theming logic.

What’s it going to be for you?

### Ridd’s Brain dump

 I think these titles are quite effective. I don't want to overuse words like future or the future of X, but I do think it's a pretty compelling title when it makes sense. Why AI has changed prototyping forever indicates this moment in time. There's a timeliness to that statement that makes people feel like the content of the episode is happening right now, which I like. The alternative title WTF is a prototype now is really effective. I don't know how easy it is to replicate something like that, but it performed quite well.  This hook is pretty short, but I think it's quite gripping. And I like the use of the single emoji. The description highlights are really solid too. Words like rethinking and phrases like less obvious make it feel like there are insights inside of the episode that you wouldn't have realized were true by default.
