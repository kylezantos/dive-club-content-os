### Not Output—Throughput

My favorite line from this conversation is:

**Treating what AI gives you not as an output, but as a *throughput.***

She might combine things dozens of times before getting to the final result.

So stop thinking of AI as a slot machine where you put text in and you get an output.

If you want to use AI like an artist, there's this back-and-forth and messy creative process as you experiment and combine outputs in new ways and try different tools and stitch tools together in new workflows—or take an output at the end of the workflow and go all the way back to the first tool and try it a different way.

There's a real opportunity to roll up your sleeves and play with these tools and forge your own path like Esha did—to create something that the world’s never seen before.

### Designing Beyond the Pixels

She’s hopping between different tools and stitching them together to create these totally new types of workflows—and that’s how she designs the real experience.

She’s contributing to the way that Comet **feels** beyond the pixels.

One example of that is the **planets**—she generated this video by using different tools, and that made for this beautiful onboarding experience.

The other is she likes music.

So she tapped into her own unique creativity and what she brings to the table, and helped create a song associated with the onboarding flow.

She even uses **Suno** as a way to express her ideas in music.

Then she trained her own models and made it so that she’s **dynamically generating a unique invite card** for every single Comet user.

Esha is the poster child for someone who is breaking out of the box of what designers think of in terms of a design deliverable.

She’s thinking at a higher level about what the end experience is and what it contains—and contributing in totally unique ways.

So that feels like the **main theme** of the episode.

### Brand + Product = Creative Freedom

I think this ties into what makes the **Perplexity brand experience team** so unique—they have a really high level of collaboration between product and brand.

Perplexity as a whole is the perfect example of a company that allows creatives and designers to tap into these new workflows and get the most out of AI.

It’s why we’re so obsessed with their brand on Twitter right now—because you have to **create space** for this type of experimentation to happen.

You have to give people the autonomy to just make it happen.

Like, Esha says that basically anytime she comes to the table with a question like,

*“What if we did this?”*

*“What if we tried that?”*

*“What if this felt like this?”*

—the response is just:

> “Cool. Sounds good. Do it. Go make it happen.”
> 

And that’s what allows her to work in these unique ways and really **reimagine what design deliverables entail**.
