# Episode 16: Escha Vera Deliverables

## Main Title + Alternatives

**Primary:** Designers who create their own design systems and ship browsers

**Alt 1:** How to transition from a year of thinking you're "unhirable" to owning a product on day one

**Alt 2:** Beyond the familiar: How Nintendo 64 nostalgia became cutting-edge browser onboarding

**Alt 3:** The most impressive first day I've seen: Getting handed the keys to build Comet

## Hook

Did you know that one of the most thoughtful approaches to AI ethics I've encountered came from a designer who almost quit the AI space entirely? Escha Vera spent a year after leaving Descript convinced she was "unhirable" – then joined Perplexity and got handed the keys to own an entire browser product on her first day. What she built next combines Nintendo 64 nostalgia, generative AI invite systems, and a design philosophy that treats AI as a creative collaborator rather than a replacement tool.

## Highlights

- Getting handed the keys to own Comet browser on day one at Perplexity (and discovering there was no design system)
- Building a generative invite system using Midjourney, Civit AI, and FAL AI that creates 10,000+ unique invites
- Creating browser onboarding inspired by Nintendo 64 startup screens – complete with custom music from producer Nesso
- The specific AI ethics questions she asked Perplexity that made her comfortable joining (and why most companies can't answer them)
- Using Suno AI as a "scratch pad for ideas" in music collaboration workflows with human producers
- Why making Comet feel familiar like Chrome was the right strategic decision for reaching lay people vs power users
- a *lot* more

## Key Takeaways

### 3 highlights from my interview with Escha

**1 — Ask the gritty details about AI ethics before you put your name behind any product**

Escha's decision to join Perplexity came down to getting confident answers to questions most companies can't or won't answer: How are models being trained? What happens to user data? How does the system actually work under the hood? She discovered that Perplexity's model selector doesn't actually choose which model runs your query – it only selects the model for the final summary, while all processing runs through multiple models in parallel with internal benchmarks determining the best fit.

> "The fact that it even hits a server once is a security risk. It's concerning to some people. It's a reason enough to not use a product."
>

Most importantly, she learned about Perplexity's trajectory toward client-side processing: "The end goal is like a year from now, two years from now, when models are efficient enough to run on the machine, you don't even have to hit a server at all." This ethical approach to data handling made her comfortable contributing her design skills to the product.

**2 — Design systems should give you building blocks, not rigid templates**

When Escha joined Perplexity, she expected to find a polished design system to match their polished product. Instead, she discovered "code is law" – the design system lived entirely in the codebase. She built a Figma system focused on core atomic components rather than complex, rigid templates: text components inside button components, list items with icons, auto-layout spacing logic baked directly into the components themselves.

> "The whole point was setting up components that any designer can easily use without having to remake it every time."
>
- Escha Vera

Her approach emphasized divisibles of eight for spacing, automatic padding built into components, and giving designers building blocks rather than prescriptive solutions. This philosophy extended to the engineering implementation, creating a one-to-one relationship between Figma components and code tokens that new engineers could inspect and implement without worrying about spacing details.

**3 — Use AI as a creative collaborator, not a replacement for doing the work**

Escha's approach to AI tools like Midjourney and Suno represents a fundamentally different philosophy than the "prompt and pray" mentality. For the Comet invite system, she spent days iterating between brand assets, Midjourney generations, Photoshop edits, and custom model training on Civit AI. Her music workflow with Suno involves generating "scratch pad ideas" and sending stems to producer Nesso for human collaboration.

> "It's not about how little can you do, it's about how much more can you do because of AI as a tool within your workflow."
>
- Escha Vera

She argues that AI criticism often misses this collaborative approach: "Most people think you just typed something, hit go, and got what you wanted. But it's actually so open-ended." Her process involves constant back-and-forth between traditional tools and AI, using her own art as inputs, creating feedback loops that generate happy accidents and new creative directions that wouldn't have been possible otherwise.
