### Description Hook

Did you know that the Head of Design at Kit (formerly ConvertKit) rejects 99.8% of design candidates before even reading their case studies? Dan Weiner has hired just 2 designers out of over 1,000 applications, and his filtering process reveals exactly why so many talented designers get passed over—and what the survivors do differently. What I found most fascinating wasn't just his hiring philosophy, but how he's preparing his team for a future where narrow execution roles become obsolete and strategic discovery leadership becomes essential.

### Description Highlights

- The 5-second visual design filter that eliminates most candidates (and why "just redesign those enterprise screens" is his controversial advice)
- His 8-skill design matrix that goes way beyond UI skills, including the collaboration and influence dimension most designers completely ignore
- The realistic one-week trial process where candidates work in Slack with the actual team (and why this "horrible" approach actually works)
- How to widen your designer role through discovery leadership when PMs think you're "too busy designing in Figma"
- The Figma-to-Cursor workflow experiment that's changing how he thinks about design systems and AI amplification
- a *lot* more

### Key Takeaways

## 3 highlights from my interview with Dan

**1 — Visual design is still the bouncer at the club**

Dan's hiring process starts with something most designers hate to hear: visual design skills act as the first elimination round. He doesn't hire people for their visual design abilities, but he rejects candidates who lack them before reading a single case study. His logic is simple—if you can't demonstrate basic visual hierarchy, typography, and spacing principles, why would he invest time evaluating your strategic thinking?

> "So many candidates are just rejected straight away by that initial glance at their visual design. And I see all these posts online where people are like, this is terrible. You're hiring people just based on graphic design skills. And it's like, no, we then have a series of other criteria that people go through, but visual design skills is a requisite for getting the role."

The controversial part? His advice for designers stuck with ugly enterprise apps: just redesign them. Nobody will check, and if they do, they'll be impressed you took initiative to show your true capabilities. It's not deception—it's demonstrating potential when constraints hold you back.

**2 — The onion layer approach to problem storytelling**

Most designers stop at the user problem layer when presenting their work, missing the crucial connection to business impact. Dan teaches his team to think about problems like an onion—you start with the interface issue (low contrast, confusing navigation) but you have to peel back layers to reveal the product metrics impact (lower conversion rates) and ultimately the business consequences (revenue loss).

> "You should be able to like start with like this very, you know, like technical detail problem, but you should be able to like unwrap that and it leads to like a problem for the business. So problem is like a multifaceted thing."

This isn't about becoming a business analyst—it's about understanding where your work fits in the larger ecosystem. Designers who can articulate this connection become strategic partners rather than pixel pushers, making them much harder to replace when teams face budget cuts.

**3 — Design systems are coming back from the dead (thanks to AI)**

Dan's week-long experiment with Figma-to-Cursor workflows revealed something unexpected: design systems aren't just about designer-developer communication anymore—they're about designer-AI communication. When he tried generating React components from Figma designs, the quality of output directly correlated with the quality of the design system foundation.

> "The better that is, the better the output is going to be. And we're definitely in a world now where with the investment in the design system, you can get to the point where engineers will not have to like create those React components from scratch."

This creates a new category of opportunity: design systems consultants focused on startups who want to unlock their design team's efficiency through AI tools. Unlike traditional enterprise-focused design systems work, this is about enabling small teams to move faster and own more of the final product experience.
