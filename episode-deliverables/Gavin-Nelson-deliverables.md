### Ridd’s Brain dump

This is another format for a title that I use from time to time. And it's basically listing three keywords, hoping that one of them will catch someone's attention. So in this case, it's prototyping, interaction design, and SwiftUI. I've done that in the past with some success. We just have to make sure that each keyword is actually compelling. I also really like the alternative title, Advanced Prototyping, because again, it gets at that level of seniority and implied intelligence of the audience where we're going really deep into things. We're not skimming the surface on topics. This isn't clickbait. This is learning in depth and substance. Now the description hook is very bad. It's incredibly boring, and I obviously did not put much thought into it. So this is a good example of what I don't want to do, because it's just stating the facts without having that first sentence that does something to pull the reader in. The description is fine. It's nothing special. I do like the newsletter title a lot, Expert Mode. It's specific. You don't know what it refers to, and I reinforce it later on in the email, in the content itself. Thank you.
