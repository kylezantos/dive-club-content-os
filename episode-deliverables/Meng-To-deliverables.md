### Description Hook

One of the most impressive things I‚Äôve seen a designer make all year is [Meng To‚Äôs Dreamcut](https://x.com/MengTo/status/1848669694800367901).

It‚Äôs the perfect example of what it looks like to transition from traditional designer to *builder üí™*¬†So if you‚Äôre interested in becoming a designer who ships then this is the episode for you.

Meng gives a highly practical breakdown of what it looks like to go from 0 to 50,000+ lines of code as a designer. And Meng is the *perfect* person to onboard you into tools like Claude and Cursor because he‚Äôs spent 10+ years teaching designers how to code through [Design+Code](https://designcode.io/).

### How to build your ideas with AI tools

If you‚Äôve never built your ideas with AI before, then here‚Äôs a breakdown of how Meng recommends you get started üëá

**1 ‚Äî Pick an idea that you care deeply about**

AI rewards designers who show perseverance. Because it‚Äôs rarely going to work on the first try. If you don‚Äôt genuinely care about what you are building then it‚Äôs too easy to give up.

> "It has to shake your core to a point where you're not gonna give up‚Äù
> 
- Meng To

Remember how Mariana said she failed the first two times she tried learning how to code? She only succeeded when she made building the primary objective instead of focusing on the next learning rung.

Maybe you solve your own problem in Figma with a plugin (ex: Meng spent 3 weeks building a simple . svg pattern plugin as a way to practice). Or perhaps you capitalize on the limitations of Figma to create a prototype that is truly function (ex: a form that users can actually submit and store data).

**2 ‚Äî Start with Claude Artifacts**

Claude Artifacts was the tipping point where Meng realized that he was now capable of building his own ideas .

If you‚Äôre not familiar, it‚Äôs a simple side-by-side view where you can prompt the AI on the left and immediately generate a product on the right.

> "Design is about function and problem solving. And if you think about design that way, Claude is really, really good at that."

**3 ‚Äî Be intentional about your first ~10 prompts**

> ‚ÄúIt's not code that scares people‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs that they don't know how to deconstruct the app in a way that makes sense to the AI‚Äù
> 
- Meng To

That word ‚Äúdeconstruct‚Äù is key üëÄ

Meng couldn‚Äôt start by asking Claude to ‚Äúbuild a video editor‚Äù. You have to think about your product from first principles and break it down into its fundamental components .

Then you can tackle each element one step at a time using simple prompts (Meng recommends staying under 3 sentences per prompt).

For DreamCut, Meng focused just on the timeline‚Ä¶ and then just on the video player. And every step of the way you have to get ultra specific. For example you can‚Äôt just say you want a video player‚Ä¶ you have to specify where the video is coming from. Are you uploading it? Are you rendering YouTube links?

This is what it means to think like an engineer.

**4 ‚Äî Invest in aesthetics**

Meng says he doesn‚Äôt worry about tweaking the styling until he‚Äôs ‚Äúready to post on Twitter‚Äù üòÜ

Most AI products revolve around TailwindCSS . If you haven‚Äôt explored their docs before it‚Äôs actually quite straightforward and I‚Äôm willing to bet you could pick it up in <30 min even if you‚Äôve never written code before.

> ‚ÄúLearning Tailwind can give you a huge leg up in understanding aesthetics‚Äù

Meng also is a big fan of using UI Kits like ShadCN as a baseline.

**5 ‚Äî Move over to Cursor**

When you get to ~400 lines of code it‚Äôs probably time to move things into Cursor . This can be a scary jump but ‚Äúyou learn it once and then you‚Äôre good.‚Äù

Cursor Composer gives you a chat UI where you can write code using natural language and have the AI explain what is happening in a way that even designers can understand.

The hardest part is setting up your local environment, installing packages like Node, etc. This is where you‚Äôre probably going to want to follow a YouTube tutorial step by step. It‚Äôs annoying but you‚Äôll get through it I promise.

---

**6 ‚Äî Manage your code base with Cursor**

For a while, all of your code will live in a single file. This is totally fine to get momentum! But at some point you‚Äôre going to want to split your code into separate pages and start turning things into reusable components.

The good news is that Cursor Composer is great at this üí™

AI will write the code and create the files for you. It‚Äôs so good that Meng‚Äôs 8 year old son was able to create a pretty sick Three.js site without knowing how to code.

Also remember that Cursor is building up context for your project as you add to it. So each feature requires less and less explanation . For instance Meng thought adding a camera recording feature would be especially difficult so he saved it until the end. But it ended up being a single prompt and it worked right away!

---

**7 ‚Äî Build in public**

Meng made a big deal about the importance of building in public.

It‚Äôs the best way to hold yourself accountable and ensure that you ultimately ship something you‚Äôre proud of.

> ‚Äú100% of my projects would fail if I wasn‚Äôt building in public‚Äù
> 
- Meng To

There will be many failures along the way‚Ä¶ heck you might not even end up in the place that you thought you would. That‚Äôs ok! Because it‚Äôs the process that matters . And I guarantee sharing your journey (failures included) will inspire others and push you to keep going.

> ‚ÄúThe only difference between a designer and an engineer is the tool‚Äù

### Ridd‚Äôs Brain dump

 How to build your ideas with AI is a good title because it's very practical. It makes it feel like you're going to learn something. Like it almost might be a little bit more like a tutorial than an interview. And again, how to is almost always worth including in the options of titles. Unless we use it too often, in which case it can become a little bit redundant. But in isolation, I think it's a fairly effective format. I think this description hook is really good because it immediately makes you want to see what dream cut is. Because saying something like, "If this is one of the most impressive things I've seen a designer make all year," is a pretty bold statement that carries some weight. There's another phrase that works really well in the description, which is, "Transition from traditional designer to builder." And this gets at that aspirational idea where people are coming to dive club because they want some kind of a transformation in their career. They want to grow. And so this episode does a good job of very clearly articulating what that growth will be from listening and reinforcing it throughout all of the messaging. The phrase, "Highly practical breakdown" in the hook is quite nice too. Any time I can highlight the fact that the episode is tactical and not fluffy, I want to do it when it makes sense. The description is good, not great. The one that is very good is the secret to an effective first-time promise. Because it feels like a very specific thing that you're learning. As far as the newsletter goes, I think the subtitle is good because it implies that the content is practical. The title, the newest design tool, is kind of lame. It's really clear what it's going to be about. It might actually present itself as not interesting for someone and they would choose to not read this because it's almost too obvious what the content is about. But it's not gripping, really. It's not bad, but it's not great. For the key takeaway, I think the title is great. How to structure a first-time promise, super practical. I also like that it very specifically walks through Meng's experience in detail. I want the content to feel like we're getting into the weeds and getting very specific about things. feel like we're skimming the surface ever.
