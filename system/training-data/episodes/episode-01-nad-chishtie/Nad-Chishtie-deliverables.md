### Description Hook

[Lovable](https://join.dive.club/lovable-content) has quickly become the go-to way I build my ideas with AI and this week we get to hear from their first designer [Nad Chishtie](https://x.com/nadonomy).

We go deep into what it takes to succeed as a founding designer and all of the ways AI is shaping modern product teams.

### Key Takeaways

## 3 highlights from my interview with Nad

**1 — Be an enabler not a bottleneck**
Too many designers operate in a waterfall mentality where things are either “designed” or “not designed”.

But when you’re growing at the speed of Lovable you can’t afford to position yourself as the keeper of all design decisions . So Nad is more than comfortable letting engineers carry things end-to-end when possible.

> “My job is to enable higher quality decisions across the board rather than making all those decisions myself and then waterfalling them onto the team”
> 
- Nad Chishtie

This means Nad thinks of quality as debt rather than a bar to hit. When you’re the first designer you have to be ok shipping some features with “design debt” to be paid off later.

**2 — Getting feedback uncomfortably fast**
Nad stresses the importance of not falling in love with your ideas (a theme Sam from Granola echoed last week too).

Because they’re going to be wrong.

The times Lovable has “failed” have been when they tried to be too visionary. Now the focus is on reducing iteration cycles and getting feedback “uncomfortably fast”.

> “How do we maximize our learning in the shortest scale possible? What that means is lots of rapid, scrappy experimentation and lots of being willing to be wrong”
> 
- Nad Chishtie

To accomplish this, Lovable puts a lot of weight on velocity of decision-making. Nad calls it having a high “clock speed” ⚡

> “What stops you from making a 10-second version of that decision on the spot instead of waiting for a meeting next week?”
>

**3 — How to be more creative with AI**
When I work with AI I’m often using adjectives that relate to interfaces (minimal, energetic, etc.).

But Nad’s advice is to break out of the UI design vocabulary .

> “Say something like, make it more art deco, make it more Bauhaus, etc. Like, don't stick to the UI styles that you see on Twitter like glass morphic or whatever”
> 
- Nad Chishtie

He even talks about building color palettes by referencing Wes Anderson films 😅

### Ridd’s Brain dump

 I like this title because it immediately makes people wonder what the new way is. Almost like they're missing out on something or there's some new arbitrage opportunity in the way that people work or a new unlock that they should be aware of. The alternative title, "How to Become a Builder with AI is Strong 2" because it implies a practicality and also gets at that idea of a transformation and personal growth. The hook is not great. There's no real attention grabber. Although I do like the personal angle about how I talked about lovable becoming the go-to way that I personally build my ideas. I feel strong because it's like an endorsement right out of the gate, but this still could be improved. As far as the description goes, I really like the specificity of the building and deleting the Figma-like layers panel because it's like, "Oh, there's an interesting story there." The newsletter title is not great. I could have come up with something more interesting and arbitrary. This kind of spoils the joke by explaining exactly what the content is going to be about. The takeaway is really strong because I talk about how I would do something normally and then how NAD suggested a better way, which that format is really, really good. I do think that this takeaway is much shorter than I would have liked though. Ideally, I would beef this up a bit or add more content somewhere.
