### Journey to Lovable through LLM experimentation and discovering GPT Engineer

Ridd (00:07.593)
Tell me the story of how you got to Lovable?

Nad (00:32.694)
I was basically hacking around with LLMs in my spare time as more of a hobby. I got infected with the curiosity, same as the rest of the world did with ChatGPT. But I was super curious about what I could use them for in design. 

At the time I was working at a scale-up that was working on secure messaging. We had really good traction in public sector and we had to do all this design work around things like accessibility and contrast ratios and meeting different accessibility standards for different platforms and different environments. It was all quite rewarding but a little bit grueling for the team.

So I started to build these little utilities using LLMs where I could do things like give an accent color to them and then use computer vision models to create a Tailwind color scale from a brand color and then do a cross-check of what are the contrast ratios when these different color combos are working.

I started building these little design utilities and just got completely bitten by this bug of, "Wow, this actually feels like this is what the future is going to be like," rather than us having to manually do everything ourselves.

That led me to an open source project called GPT Engineer, which was a project made by Anton, who's one of our founders. He had basically started experiments with LLMs for the same reason, but completely in parallel over in Sweden, where he felt that he was a CTO of a YC startup, really loved what he was doing, but he got quite frustrated because he thought that all of his engineering peers were being too unimaginative with LLMs.

He would be able to see five, ten years into the future and he'd be thinking most code in the world is going to be written by LLMs and people would say no to him and tell him he was wrong. So he got really frustrated and put together a proof of concept called GPT Engineer, which was basically a command line tool where you ask the AI to build something. If it doesn't know what you mean, it asks you a question back and otherwise it just builds for you.

Nad (02:56.75)
He built that and then overnight - well, not quite overnight - that became one of the largest, most popular code gen projects on GitHub. That went from zero to 52,000 stars on GitHub. 

I basically found that project, started playing around with it, then reached out to Anton and did some advisory stuff to begin with. A bit of contracting and a little bit of "let's go from zero design to some design." But then flew over to meet the team in person and since then basically just decided to go all in.

### Technical background and engineering-minded approach to design

Ridd (03:27.743)
Quick context, how much of a technical background do you have as a designer?

Nad (03:32.767)
I would never call myself an engineer, but I've always seen it as almost a professional responsibility to really understand my materials. I've just always hacked on the front end and I've always strived to be technical enough that I can have a high frequency, high bandwidth conversation with the people I'm working really closely with.

I could understand and go quite deep on things like technical architecture, but always in a way that relates back to design. I would say engineering-minded in the abstract and I can communicate very well with engineers.

Ridd (04:16.413)
You're the perfect type of person that gets superpowers from a product like Lovable and you get to create that future. I would imagine it's quite fulfilling right now.

Nad (04:25.89)
Yeah, 100%. I feel very fortunate with my shape and skill set and where all of this is going. But I also think it's a bit of a correction in some sense. As designers, we know that form follows function and that they're as important as each other. But I feel like in the digital design world, we just obsess over form. Now, at least with AI, we can sort of widen back again and be way more cross-domain and way more cross-functional.

### Being the sole designer at Europe's fastest growing startup and the philosophy of design enablement

Ridd (05:02.175)
Let's talk about Lovable now. Roughly ten engineers, every day there's a new AI advancement. It's the fastest growing startup in European history. What the heck is that like as the sole designer?

Nad (05:16.878)
Really fun, I guess, first of all. There's definitely stressful moments or moments of being underwater, but overall energy giving rather than energy taking. I think that's the most important thing because if that wasn't the case, then everything else would be more difficult. But super high-paced. Internally and culturally, we put a very, very high emphasis on maximizing learning above everything else.

The way that we think about things and the way that I work is I'm trying to challenge myself across both individual velocity, but also team velocity. And so for me, what that means is as a designer, I'm an enabler. The way that I see things is that design decisions are happening all of the time. Everyone in every single team, everywhere is making decisions that in some way will resolve into user impact at the end of the day.

My job is to enable higher quality decisions across the board, rather than making all those decisions myself and then waterfalling them onto the team. What that means in practice is a lot of the engineers are carrying things end to end, as much as possible. And I'm basically guiding them. So it's less so much about here's the perfect design that will exist in the abstract on a Figma canvas and then we go and create it and more so about let's align first of all on what problems we're going to solve. The engineers have a lot of latitude on how to solve those. And then we kind of pair up on the best user experience along the way.

---
### Removing designer bottlenecks and managing quality through design debt philosophy

Ridd (07:01.823)
When it makes sense, you're basically removing yourself as a bottleneck when you're operating at a level of velocity that is required in this type of industry in this stage of the company.

Nad (07:11.692)
Yeah, exactly. I think that even when I've been in larger teams, I've found this to be a healthy mode of operation as well. Because first of all, it's not that designers have the best ideas, unfortunately. The very best things happen from collaborating and also come from the most unexpected places. And so I've always tried really hard to avoid this sort of feeling of waterfall or that things are either designed or they're not designed. When the reality is that if people can update the products, it's always getting designed by someone.

Ridd (07:50.602)
Yeah. I'm sure there's somebody listening right now that's like, well, how do you ensure the right level of quality in the product when engineering in theory could take smaller things end to end and everything's being shaped all at once. And especially as the first designer, I don't know if you've ever experienced this. I've sometimes felt this fear of pushing something to prod that isn't up to my bar because I know it's never going to get prioritized. Everything's moving too quickly where that thing might be cemented for a full year as the product roadmap grows.

Nad (08:26.798)
Yeah, 100%. The way that I think about this is, I think about this as almost like a deficit. And so I think about quality as debt. I'm never thinking about quality being this bar that needs to be met. It's more so this deficit or this feeling that can go up and down. For sure, there's features that go out where we're in debt. And so we need to pay off that debt in future.

I see this sort of living thing where we create debt and we pay it off. And it's just this constant moving cycle. The reason why I think about quality as debt rather than a bar is that it also means that we can translate those conversations internally to things like technical debt. And it becomes very easy to then advocate for paying off some of this design debt alongside technical debt.

### Lessons from multiple founding designer experiences and working at the intersection of founders and market

Ridd (09:21.075)
You've done the founding designer role multiple times now. Before we get into the weeds of how you work at Lovable, I kind of want to stay a little bit higher level and tap into your perspective as someone who has been in this situation multiple times. And at least for me, every time I start with the blank canvas as the first designer, it's this opportunity to take everything that I've learned, all my past experiences, and figure out the right things that I want to tweak or the ways that I want to do differently. I'm curious if that resonates and if there are certain ways that you're taking advantage of this blank slate as a designer at Lovable.

Nad (10:00.75)
Yeah, for sure. The way that I think about it is that I really love working with founders. Founders are great because I think it takes a lot of conviction to sort of go from something just never existing to "okay, this is actually going to exist out in the world." And as a first designer, I think you sit in this intersection of founders and the market.

What you're doing is just trying to tap into this raw ambition, raw conviction, and make it understandable for everyone else. And there should be this healthy push-pull of, you know, there's things that just exist because that was in the original vision of the team or individual people. And there's other things where you get completely led by the market and it's more so about, we were completely wrong about this. But here's these other amazing things that surprise you and take you by surprise.

I find repeatedly interesting is sitting between these two and having a healthy push-pull between them.

### Advice for startup designers: curiosity, learning speed, and applying research superpowers everywhere

Ridd (11:11.837)
Any advice for someone who's interested in designing at startups that they could pull from or tap into some of your learnings for how to succeed in that environment where you're sitting in between the market and the founder and everything's moving so quickly?

Nad (11:28.706)
Yeah, I think be insanely curious, learn extremely quickly, don't fall in love with your ideas because they're going to be wrong and just iterate. Everything that every single startup trope you've heard of like talk to your users, talk to your customers, you know, build what people want. Just do that on repeat and everything else will fall out of it.

I think the biggest enabler for me has been constant learning. Learning both about users, the market, how your product's doing, where it's failing, but also learning about people as well. I'd really recommend getting to know the people you've worked the closest with as well as you can.

I think designers actually have such a superpower and anyone that has any kind of research discipline, the fact that we get taught and we learn how to talk to people, decode them into goals, desires, fears. Just apply those research superpowers to absolutely everything. Apply it to talking to a finance person about how their finance operations are going or their reporting processes, but just go around the entire team or the entire org and just pretend it's a user research problem. And if you do that on repeat, I think there's almost nothing that can't be solved.

---
### Being a thought partner to founders and filtering good ideas from noisy ones

Ridd (12:57.885)
I love that because it's even great advice for how to interface with a founder too. Treating them like a research project, helping them navigate the weeds of their own mind and all of the ideas and untangling things. I think that's something that I've picked up from a lot of these conversations is that a trait of a great first designer is being an effective thought partner for that founder and helping them even sequence and think through all of the ideas, because there's a million ideas, all of them are good. Okay, well, how do we make sense of the right ones in the right order and what good ideas to ignore in the early stages?

Nad (13:34.479)
Yeah, 100%. I think you have to, I think it comes with time, but I think once you have a good amount of trust and a good amount of gel, you start to build a bit of intuition around what are the really noisy ideas where these are probably just never gonna work versus what are the ones that we should entertain a little bit because there's probably a sliver of one aspect or one shade of it that could have a completely outsized impact if this works. But yeah, I completely agree.

---
### Balancing current possibilities with future AI breakthroughs and avoiding premature vision

Ridd (14:05.887)
Can we double click on that piece? Because you're in an interesting place now where, yeah, that's a universal part of being a startup designer, but you're also designing in a space where you're betting on a massive amount of technological breakthrough, which will change the entire industry. And so my sense is you're probably straddling these two worlds of what's possible today versus where this all might go. How does that impact the way that you explore and test out different ideas, even with, even in conversation with a founder.

Nad (14:40.172)
Yeah, so I think again, it all comes down to learning. What I think about and what we think about as a team a lot is just how do we maximize our learning in the shortest scale possible? And so what that means is lots of rapid, scrappy experimentation, lots of being willing to be wrong and just putting things out there to see what sticks.

Where we have failed actually has been when we've tried to be too visionary. There's been a couple of projects or a couple of angles where we've worked on a problem and we've thought the models are going to do this in six months time. And actually in some cases, we've listened too much to the foundation model providers where they've said these things are on the horizon. So therefore you should be thinking about building in this way for nine months time or whatever. Whenever we've gone down that route, we've had suboptimal results. Whereas whenever we've really reduced our iteration cycles, really spoken deeply to our users, really shipped small pieces first, and then built iteratively from there. We've generally come to a good outcome.

I think that was true pre-AI, that you should always be scoping things down to the smallest version possible. I think it's still true. I think there's obviously going to be still big bets, especially when there's the huge step change in model capability. You need to be ready for that. But again, even learning with a new model, I think you should approach that very iteratively of starting small and then building up slowly from there.

### Visual edits feature development: from instant feedback philosophy to direct manipulation

Ridd (16:21.183)
I want to go really deep into how you work and maybe we could use the visual edits feature that you just released as a window into just what day to day is and how you work through different ideas. And so maybe we could start all the way at the very beginning when presumably you've identified this broad opportunity space. How were you then as a designer exploring and bringing clarity to what that could be?

Nad (16:49.388)
Yeah. So I think actually if I challenge myself to really go back. So we had this deep fundamental philosophical belief that the best AI engineer or the best product of our shape would almost feel like a whizzy big tool. It would be like instant feedback the same way that if you draw a rectangle on a canvas in Figma, it's just there instantly at 120 frames per second, or whatever your screen is refreshing at. And we wanted that to feel, we wanted our product to feel as instant as that.

Since day one, we just felt that that's going to enable, it's going to promote being able to build the best products. And some of our competitors didn't think like this at all. Obviously super famously, Cognition launched Devin and they just went full blown agent of actually LLMs can write code. Instead, we're going to visualize a desktop and you're going to fire something over to this engineer and it's going to spend four hours processing things and then come back or whatever.

There's obviously two extremes between a WYSIWYG tool and that, but we were always trying to figure out where do we sit along this scale? And every single time we index more on back on instant feedback, we never regretted it. Since day one, we always wanted to have, we always wanted the core experience to be as rewarding as possible, as fast as possible.

Visual edits were never really, it's not like we ever planned them. It's not like they were a roadmap item that needed to be prioritized. They'd just always been on the horizon since day one, because it just felt intuitive to us that you'll always want to directly manipulate software.

That's why we did them. And then when we built them, I mean, we actually built two versions of them almost. So the very first version that we built our going hypothesis was that design tools have solved a bunch of problems. And really what we're adding uniquely is the ability to collaborate with AI and manipulate the outcome in a known way.

Nad (19:07.072)
And so the first version that we built was actually super familiar to anyone that has used any of Photoshop, Sketch, Figma, Insert Design Tool here over the last 20, 30 years. So we had a layers panel where you could browse all of your layers. We had a properties panel where you could inspect things and then manipulate them. All the good stuff. But we had this moment where we realized that actually these things haven't really moved since the 90s.

The very first version of Photoshop had a layers panel in I think 1992 or something like that. And so we started to ask ourselves from first principles, why haven't things evolved? And we thought there was a good reason for previous shifts. If you look at desktop to web, it kind of makes sense. You still have a desktop computer, so a desktop interface makes sense. But what we realized was that actually now with AI, we think we can move forward genuinely forward rather than iteratively.

What we did is we actually deleted the layers panel because we realized that who cares about layers. I think the fact that there's even such a debate amongst designers about who names or doesn't name your layers. It's such a leading indicator that do we actually care about this?

Ridd (20:20.933)
Naming or not, yeah. Don't delete my group 1427.

Nad (20:28.586)
Yeah, exactly. So we built a layer panel, we got rid of it, we built more styling, we got rid of it. Even down to, so I'm quite technical, so I know Flexbox quite well, for example. And so in a tool like Webflow, I'm quite at home if I want to be use justify between at this responsive break point or whatever, it gives me more control. But we just had this revelation, we were like, who wants to learn Flexbox?

Who wants to sit down and be like, I'm going to ingest all of this crazy domain knowledge in order to just create something that I like and create something that I want other people to like. And so we basically built this sort of design tool version first, had an existential breakdown, deleted half of it, and then shipped this simpler version afterwards.

The simpler version basically rests on, we're trying to find this tension where when do you want to manipulate things directly versus when is it actually just better to use AI? And so we're trying to find these moments or these key interactions where natural language is superior versus when natural language is inferior. And so most of the design process was trying to find those lines.

### Scrapping layers panels and traditional design tool paradigms for AI-native workflows

Ridd (21:48.863)
Did you actually ship the full layer panels to even like a beta or was it just internally you had this sense that this is not the direction that we should go?

Nad (21:58.665)
For that one specifically, was internally. That was we built it and we used it and then we slept on it and then we woke up the next day and we were just like, "no."

Ridd (22:07.719)
Yeah. The grand reveal of the next morning. Do you still like it or not?

Ridd (22:15.857)
Even, I want to keep going even deeper because even within this new smaller contained ballpark of okay, we don't want the full layers panel, but we still want to find the right level of affordances to give users to make these more precision changes. What were some of the things that you were wrestling with as a designer even figuring out how to implement that version?

Nad (22:43.468)
Yeah, so I think the word that the team got really bored of hearing from me was progressive disclosure. We were basically just trying to figure out do we show and when and how do we do it progressively? Where we landed was basically a single panel where first of all, the feature is almost invisible. If you're not a designer and you are never going to care about manually setting a color palette for your app or whatever, you probably won't even notice that the button exists in our interface. And that was very deliberate because actually, not everyone is a designer as well. A lot of our users as well are people building apps for the first time. So first of all, the entire feature is completely hidden. And secondly, it gets more progressively complex once you drill down into more advanced properties.

Most of the work was figuring out how should we be progressive over time?

---
### Progressive disclosure principles and designing for non-designers building apps

Ridd (23:46.72)
Do you have any thoughts on where this could go or are you viewing visual edits as a building block for any future explorations? How are you thinking about that?

Nad (23:59.535)
Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think coming back to when I was saying that we think that the best tool is completely instant. We see a lot more value in just continuing to build this out. And so the eventual goal will be to have something where you have as fine grained pixel level control as you can get from a fully fledged design tool.

Where I'm less certain is will the shape be design tools as we know it? Just because I think there's an opportunity to declare a lot of what we've got used to as legacy. And that's where we'll probably experiment a lot more. It's where we'll probably get a few things more wrong before we get things a few things more right. It's where perhaps people might feel a bit more frustrated because this thing's just plainly missing. Like if you do want to name a layer, you can't just one click go. But I think with maybe a one or two year view, I think it's the right thing to do, rather than just sleepwalking into assuming that we need the tools of the past in the future.

---
### Future of visual edits and declaring legacy design tools obsolete

Ridd (25:07.955)
Yeah. It's not just the tools of the past though. You're in a really fascinating space and I basically never ask about competitors on this show, but I think I am going to ask you if that's okay because I mean, you're just in this unprecedented little collection of companies where you're not the only young rocket ship even everything's moving so fast all eyes are on this suite of products so how do you think about the right level to even pay attention to what's happening around you as a designer at one of these companies?

Nad (25:40.141)
Yeah, I mean, so first of all, I'd say it's really fun, as in working in tech in this space right now is as fun as, if I feel as energized as I did when I was a kid doing this for the very first time. So that's really great. What's less great is it can be super distracting. Even just scrolling over Twitter whilst having a coffee or whatever, there are thousands of things that can suck you in. And so that's a bit of a personal battle. So I've had to up my, I don't know, my phone lives on do not disturb 24 seven, because my life is better that way. And I try not to, I try to time box a lot for anything that could be a distraction.

But it's super energizing, honestly, it feels like, and I can only say this with hindsight, it felt like things got little bit stagnant. We kind of had mobile and obviously that was a huge shift. And then as a designer, then we started to think about designing cross-platform and things like design ops. But we kind of understood SaaS, right? It was of course there was going to be new SaaS companies, but it was what it was. It's deliver some value, charge people for it a recurring basis, more or less. And now everything's changing. And I think that's awesome. So ultimately it's a super fun, super energy giving.

---
### Competitive landscape management and staying energized while avoiding distractions

Ridd (27:17.855)
Do have any beliefs or hypotheses about the future of the state of design tooling that you're working backwards from as a designer?

Nad (27:27.374)
So I think the future will be, I think the same way that developers have, I'll start again. So I think the same way that developers have their own development environments. If you look at IDEs, the I stands for independent. And the reason why every development environment can be independent is because code is interoperable, right? It's you can have your source code, store it somewhere. Developers can pick and choose how they want to work individually, per device even, and everything just works.

And I think the future of design will be really similar. And so I think there's going to be multiple winners. I don't really see there being there'll be one AI design tool that will win. Likewise, I don't even see it that the incumbents are the best positioned. I think there'll be, I can imagine almost niche tools for niche purposes, depending on whether it's motion or doing more detailed color work or using shaders or whatever it might be.

But I think now with LLMs, code can be the source of truth rather than design files. And I think that's going to enable this interoperability and therefore design tools being able to work independently but contribute to the same source.

---
### Future of design tooling: code as source of truth and independent development environments

Ridd (28:35.977)
Yeah, I think it even goes back to some of the emphasis on learning and curiosity that you were talking about earlier. It's the first time in so long that there's a real fracturing of the market and maybe we're inning one and I think we are but Gosh, I mean, all we talked about was Figma for a long time, like many years. And I do believe that they're going to make some kind of a play. And you know, we have config here in a couple months and everyone has their ideas of what that could look like. But the fact is there are a lot of really interesting niche tools and a lot of different ways that designers can visualize their ideas now, which is very exciting.

Nad (29:11.886)
100%. And I think also I think niche tools should be celebrated. I think in tech, in venture capital, the name of the game is always who's going to win. And it's always who can get majority market share. But especially now with AI, that we can write software cheaper, I think we should be celebrating the fact that we can create more single purpose tools that can focus on one problem and doing that really well.

---
### Celebrating niche tools and the benefits of cheaper software creation with AI

Ridd (29:40.16)
Have you played with Unicorn Studio out of curiosity? That's the perfect example of a niche tool for me where it's no code WebGL and there's not that many people tinkering with it but the people that are are just making the most incredible output on Twitter is obviously where I'm seeing it and it just, I look at something like that and I'm like, man, I'm so excited for the long tail of tooling.

Nad (30:03.224)
For the, so I haven't played around with it, so for the uneducated, what is it? And what should I do? What should the first thing I do be if I play around with it?

Ridd (30:12.543)
So that's the thing is it's so art forward because it's just open-ended web GL where you can create these really detailed 3d motion effects and then it exports a Format that you can embed as a framework component for instance and so one of the things I helped with is making this 3d moving orb, but it's all controlled in code, you know, it's not a video file and so it's a. It raises the ceiling for what you can do with these crazy visual details. Maybe in a similar way that something like Rive would for animation. I'm a tooling nerd, so this is just a fun time to be someone who does spend too much time scrolling on Twitter getting distracted.

Nad (30:56.942)
Cool. You've added one distraction to my list.

---
### Unicorn Studio discussion and the excitement for long-tail tooling diversity

Ridd (31:01.407)
Yeah, speaking of distractions, actually, I do want to get nerdy for a second here because I was looking at your roadmap and I saw MCP in the next up column, which is one of those buzzwords that you're seeing all the time on Twitter now. And I don't know, I'm sure other people that have come across it feel the same FOMO that I do. So do you have the ability to explain what that might mean or what it might unlock for designers in the future?

Nad (31:31.661)
Yeah, so MCP stands for model context protocol and in typical computer scientist fashion, it's a terrible name. We are terrible at naming things generally. So all it is, is it's just a standardized way for models to talk to other things. And so if you're building with AI, you're able to integrate MCP and anything else that integrates MCP will just be able to interoperate.

We're using MCP right now, something that we're cooking up at Lovable where we'll be integrating with MCP servers on things like Stripe, as well as things like web scrapers, as well as SuperBase, which we use for building full stack applications. Where because we've done one integration with MCP, Lovable will just interoperate with all of these things really well. And so what we'll see is we'll go from this world of LLMs being little silos where they have their own history, their own knowledge, and that's kind of self-contained and separately one particular SaaS platform being its own silo over there as well, to just all of these things being able to talk to each other.

So that's the dream. That's the pitch. Pretty bleeding edge though. And I think there's also a lot of promises being made that actually maybe aren't quite being met yet. And so we'll see where this goes, but it's super exciting.

---
### Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the future of AI interoperability

Ridd (32:54.207)
Can we talk about the super base piece for a second? Because that was actually my aha moment with lovable was when I could just connect it to a database, talk to the database and make changes without having to get into the schemas or really understand how anything's actually working behind the scenes. What was that like designing that integration and even more broadly creating interactions that try to simplify and demystify some of the technical things that are happening behind the scenes? How do you figure out where that line of abstraction versus control exists for users?

Nad (33:30.871)
Yeah. So the super base integration, we made it because we had this deep fundamental belief that most people, so again, we integrated super base because we wanted to enable people to create full stack applications. And so before Lovable existed, there was multiple options to create a landing page, static website or whatever, but super difficult to create a real working application. And so we looked at a bunch of different options and we really liked what Supabase was doing. And so it's a bit of a no brainer to use that or to enable people to have to use that for a backend.

How we designed it, we basically shipped the simplest, smallest version of it that we could. And then we just, we did two different things after that. The first thing is we added to it very slowly with a bunch of user onboarding calls. So we had it in private beta for a while, and then we would onboard people into it one by one. And then just simply, just classic iterative product development.

That was one thing that really surprised us actually with all of this was that people are really willing to go on quite a long self-education journey with these tools. And so I think classical thinking has been this whole sort of don't make me think and reduce friction, reduce friction. But what we're seeing is that people are very stimulated. And so people can do things that they never could do before. They're doing things that they could never even imagine before. And actually what's happening is that as soon as people get a taste of wow, I can actually do this for myself, they're willing to go on this entire self-education journey of let me go and let me learn what about databases even I don't know what one is. I'm going to Google what is a database. I'm going to sit on YouTube for two hours learning about what a managed backend is or whatever it might be.

In terms of where we landed, we had these early indicators that people felt very empowered by being able to create full stack. And we also had this early indication that people were willing to educate. So in the end.

Nad (35:55.917)
We actually cared less about what is the technical abstraction and what is jargon? Because jargon is quite individually dependent, depending on your domain knowledge. And so I think we've struck an okay balance so far of just explaining what it is and the value of it, and then trying to hold your hand at key moments. But I think we can do a lot more. And so we're right in the middle at the moment of just to be a little bit technical, but not too technical.

---
### Supabase integration design and user willingness for technical self-education journeys

Ridd (36:26.503)
It makes sense what you're saying about getting a little taste because that's just my experience. You've been reflecting back on the journey. It's you get so much value and you're so interested in that first 10 seconds. The first time you generate anything, you're like, holy smokes, that was crazy. Let's do it again. And right away, you're very motivated to keep going I guess and I don't know I blinked in the next thing I'm reading Twilio Docs because I want to hook up the API You know I had no intention of doing this, but it's addicting You know it's just fun to try to solve the next problem, and then the next problem the next problem

Nad (37:00.92)
Yeah, a hundred percent. It's I think fun is the word. We think a lot about flow. And so as designers, we know this, right? You know, when you're in flow and you know, when you almost lose all concept of time. And really one of our driving philosophies is just trying to figure out what promotes and what detracts flow. And so when we think about things that way, it's actually quite surprising how many technical concepts or how many technical abstractions, might initially seem like they're quite domain specific, but if they're promoting flow and if they're empowering you as you build, it's still super fun. And so that feels like a good outcome for us.

---
### The addictive nature of AI-powered building and designing for flow states

Ridd (37:46.698)
We talked about promoting flow, speed to feedback. It's clear that you do have these philosophies as this team that are guiding you. So are there any other that we have not talked about that are serving as your North star as a designer?

Nad (38:05.326)
One thing we talk about a lot is clock speed or this idea of clock speed. And so we think that we build the best product by learning as much as possible, always. And we think we learn as much as possible by having an uncomfortably high clock speed, individually and as a team. And so we try to challenge ourselves on how long do we take to make a specific decision?

Does this communication need to take us long, rather than arriving at a conclusion and being like, let me sense check that with someone else and put in a meeting for next week. What stops you from making a 10 second version of that decision on the spot instead. And so we challenge ourselves on clock speed a lot. And that I think that's paid dividends when it comes to overall learning on our capabilities and what we can build. It comes with the trade-off that you sometimes that can come in the face, that scrappiness can come in the face of quality. But so far, I mean, that's basically given us a super powerful product that people love with really great fit where I'd rather have the quality challenge of quality can always be better than with some fit rather than the other way around.

---
### Clock speed philosophy: maximizing learning through uncomfortably fast decision-making

Ridd (39:22.623)
Is there an example where you've prioritized clock speed and just pulled the trigger on a decision versus turning it into this debate internally?

Nad (39:31.065)
Honestly, probably every major feature that we shipped. The visual edits, for example, for sure we had this philosophical debate on layers panels and let's see if we have a shot at making these legacy. But it was also okay, there's one path where we simmer on this for days to weeks more. There's another path where we just remove it from the conversation and we can get new feedback uncomfortably fast.

And so I guess we're trying to embrace that uncomfortable part of uncomfortably fast.

---
### Examples of prioritizing speed over deliberation in major feature decisions

Ridd (40:07.283)
I feel some conviction because I've been using the word simmer a lot lately as I work on a new product. Let's talk about your personal process a little bit more. When are you reaching for lovable in your own design journey?

Nad (40:24.322)
Yeah, so I, and this is very subjective, very personal. So in general with design, I always start big to small. And so I'm very much okay, hierarchy first information within that, and then content design. And then once I'm happy with content, then lay it out. And so in terms of my design process, I try to ask the big questions first. I try to figure out what I want from a content perspective. And then depending on what the feature is, I'll either reach for Figma to figure out the best way to lay out the information, or if it's interactive, these days I just go straight for lovable.

I think where I was getting frustrated by design tools was just the whole pool noodling of needing 500 artboards with the most perfect orchestration in order to build what I wanted. Whereas now I just generally will design maybe the first state in Figma. And then punch out to lovable and then just make an interactive from that. And so I'll jam with the AI to work through live prototypes.

---
### Personal design process: from hierarchy to interactive prototyping with Lovable

Ridd (41:33.503)
Can you talk a little bit about what jamming with the AI looks like for you and any lessons or tips that you've picked up along the way to help designers become better at prompting?

Nad (41:43.503)
I would say treat AI as a creative partner. It's surprisingly good. If you do any in any other creative discipline, experimentation is always good. Actually a lack of structure is where you find where you find novel solutions. And so rather than thinking, okay, I need to have the structure and the perfect idea. And I need to translate that for this AI to then execute on what I think is in my head.

Just be super open and just jam with it the same way. I don't know if you're a musician and you're just jamming with someone, just go for it and things will just happen. And this is the same as if a photographer, a photographer doesn't try to manipulate light perfectly, they set up a shot and the shot is in the right direction. But you know, nature provides some light and the photons bounce around in an unexpected way. And then at some point something beautiful happens and that's when you're okay, I've got it. And just treat designing with AI the exact same way.

I'd say obviously you need to exercise your own taste and you need to apply your own filter on everything that happens. But I'd say don't expect it to be perfect and don't try to be perfect. Just go with it.

---
### Treating AI as a creative partner and prompting advice for designers

Ridd (42:53.609)
Do you have an example of when collaborating with AI took you to a place that was a little bit unexpected, but it turned out pretty awesome?

Nad (43:00.718)
Happens all the time with content design, I'd say. And sometimes the hallucinations are actually really great for this as well, especially with naming features. So yeah, definitely more on the content design front. I'm trying to think of anything interesting on the visual or interaction side. Yeah, actually one thing that I'd really recommend anyone to do is pick up a pick up an AI powered design tool, or a tool like Lovable and actually just feed it different art styles.

Building UI that you like, it's going to look probably a little bit vanilla to begin with, but as soon as you start to think about adding personality, actually just ask it to style things for you and almost act like an artistic creative director and go crazy because these models are trained on the entirety of human knowledge. And so if you say something like, make it more art deco or make it more Bauhaus or whatever. Don't stick to the UI styles that you see on Twitter of I don't know, Glassmorphic or whatever. Think of anything visual and they do a surprisingly good job. And so yeah, just treating it as a creative collaborator, not just on the functional parts, but everything else is super, it can be super rewarding.

---
### Unexpected AI collaborations and using art styles beyond typical UI conventions

Ridd (44:23.763)
I love that. You're totally right. There's a lexicon of adjectives that relate to UI and I almost exclusively use those when I'm interfacing with AI about a set of visuals. That's such a great piece of advice. Just breaking out, I can say anything. I can say anything and it's gonna generate something. So I might as well use that as a way to break out of the box of what I'm capable of imagining.

Nad (44:48.194)
Yeah, 100%. And one thing, when we were working on, we didn't shift any of this, but when we were working on auto generating color scales, I was feeding in a lot of, I'm a big cinematography nerd, so I was feeding in a lot of stills from some of my favorite films and some of my favorite cinematographers. And so you could even be hey, here's a shot from my favorite Wes Anderson's flick. And like, let's make this feel more Anderson. And it does a surprisingly good job. It's super fun.

---
### Breaking out of UI lexicon limitations and drawing inspiration from cinematography

Ridd (45:21.897)
How much of a role as a designer at Lovable are you playing in shaping the interactions that users are having with the AI, the specific words that are coming out, any system prompt stuff versus the interface itself? Is that part of the role for you?

Nad (45:35.469)
Yeah, it's both. I started out on the interface side, so of course, the first problem to solve was let's put together our UI that people are going to interact with. But you kind of quickly realize that setting the line height of the AI response isn't really designing AI. What people do with it kind of is.

So yeah, for sure. We have, it's pretty, I'd say it's pretty meritocratic internally in terms of the way that we build our AI, everybody in the edit, everybody in the company can edit how it thinks and how it works. And so actually most people in the company contribute to it and even non-engineers. And so if there is, I'm trying to think of an example, for example, one of the people who works on our support, they're contributing to the core AI all of the time and they're closing the loop from, what would typically be a customer service problem to just feeding back to the AI to just improve things on the spot. And we have that feedback loop there as well.

---
### Designing AI interactions and the meritocratic approach to system prompt contributions

Ridd (46:44.671)
It's not the first time I've heard it where people on support or growth teams are contributing back to the core system prompts. And I think it's a really interesting trend where I was kind of mentioning this earlier, companies fall into two buckets right now. You have companies that are adapting to AI and you have companies that have been birthed from AI and AI and its capabilities are at the center of how they work and how they operate, how they think.

I'm wondering how much that resonates and if there are other examples where you can point to the way that the org operates at lovable that is distinct and unique from what you've experienced in the past because of the fact that lovable is an AI native team.

Nad (47:28.462)
Yeah, so I think almost every bit of people infrastructure that we've got used to creating, I think it's a bit challenging in general. And I don't mean to be too alarmist with that. It's just the reality of what I'm seeing. And not just across Lovable as well, by the way. There's other companies, also much larger, that are doing this AI-first pivot and seeing this as well. So in Europe, Klarna quite famously is doing this and also intercom as well have been pretty public about doing this kind of pivot.

I think entire functions can collapse and merge, which is really interesting. At my last company, we had so many people that sat between product and customers where they were almost just different flavors of the same problem. So we would have product managers and researchers and solutions architects and pre-sales engineers and account managers. And this kind of laundry list of people where the job was know the product and know the customer, but solve a different part of different parts of this flow.

That's a really good example of okay, you could collapse almost all of that down to either one function or very few people. And I've seen that across the board, entirely. And so I think we have the benefit as a new company of rather than having to pivot all of this to the new world. We can just stop. But I for sure think it's the future and where things are going.

---
### AI-native organizations and the collapse of traditional company functions

Ridd (49:03.263)
How does the value proposition of design shift in that new world?

Nad (49:09.218)
So I think... I think, I mean, the obvious thing that everyone says is that taste is going to be paramount. I think that's a hundred percent true. The other thing that I find really interesting and I've thought about this for years and I'd love to get your perspective as well is I find it interesting when different industries use the term design in different ways. And so for example, I'm a huge Formula One nut and I love motorsports. I also love aerospace and the chief most engineer in those industries is the chief designer. And so why is it that all of these other industries, being a designer is just so fundamentally different to being what we call a designer in tech.

I think we'll see more of those, more of that merger. And so I think design and engineering is quite an obvious one, but actually, in a lot of ways, I think they are two sides of the same coin. And so now with the advent of AI, I think that can merge in very new and exciting ways as well as cross-functionally in other ways, like say design and product management for sure.

---
### The evolving value proposition of design: taste and cross-industry design perspectives

Ridd (50:17.917)
Yeah, that was the piece that I was going to add on where even going back to what you were talking about in the very beginning where you're sitting in between the founder and the market. That's designed at a very high level. It's positioning as design. How do I want to design the shape of the entire product offering and how does that fit into the different opportunities that I'm seeing? And I'm excited in a world where, yeah, we can even further increase the speed of iteration and more people are capable of shipping and getting something out the door. That part of design is exciting to me too, where it's the very strategic product level design, market level design.

Nad (51:01.23)
Yeah, a hundred percent. And I think it's all to play for as well at the moment. I think if it's maybe easy to forget that tech is quite young. We've literally gone from websites in the nineties to web 2.0 to here we are. And there's a lot of management practices or a lot of company structure things that we just sort of made organically. And it's not the way we've arrived at organically isn't because it's the most optimal design, it's just because it's what happened incidentally.

I think the other thing that's really easy to forget is that, I mean, one of the reasons why I love tech is that there's almost no barriers to what you can do. But the other side of that is that we also end up with bad managers, frankly, we end up with people who are not trained or not, they maybe shouldn't be in that position. And this also extends to founders in a lot of ways as well. And so means that we build functions and entire companies around quite imperfect or suboptimal structures as well. And so I think all of it's up for play at the moment. So whatever we've considered traditionally of product design and engineering and these formal lines between them, I think we can blur if not eradicate as much as possible.

---
### Strategic design thinking and the opportunity to restructure traditional tech roles

Ridd (52:25.471)
Can we speak to someone who's listening, who is excited about everything you're saying? Conceptually, it makes sense. And yet there's still this chasm that they're having to cross to figure out how does a tool like Lovable fit into my everyday workflow at working at a company that isn't pushing the boundaries of AI? They're probably still working on that SaaS. And it's okay, but where does a tool like Lovable sit into my process? And how can I even think about using it to push my craft forward?

Nad (52:56.172)
Yeah, I mean, there's also the reality that it might not, might just not be the fit as well. So you know, there are other tools. So for example, we don't support, importing. If you have an existing application, you can't bring that in and then edit it. But what I would say is coming back to this idea of constant learning, you learn so much by shipping, end to end.

If you are non-technical, as in you're not an engineer who can develop, build, deploy, maintain full-stack applications. You can do that now for anything you want. And so just even the sheer act of solving something that feels like a small problem to you, you can build it, you can ship it, you can give it to people and you can learn from it. And that in itself, I think is incredibly rewarding and will reveal, you're going to learn things and you're going to reveal more about yourself even.

I think, yeah, I would encourage people to play with it from that perspective. It's just, and don't, even if you're not, I don't know, commercially minded, even if you're not thinking like, I want to start my own startup or I want to do X, Y, and Z, just do it for fun. The same way that you would, I don't know, make a loved one, a home cooked meal, just make a loved one an act and just see what happens.

### Practical advice for designers at traditional companies wanting to adopt AI tools

Ridd (54:17.215)
I started making birthday cards in Lovable. I made one for my dad where it's I can deliver it. I make a QR code and that's the card and then you scan the card and then it's custom website with little fun little animations and it's why not? It's fun.

Nad (54:34.072)
That's awesome. And do they like them as well?

Ridd (54:37.151)
So yeah, it's great. It's totally unique, totally unique. It doesn't even take that much time, you know, but it's just a fun way to be creative. I've started lowering the bar basically for what I can make. I made my first foray into super bass was a Super Bowl betting game where I asked 20 questions for the most popular Super Bowl prop bets. And then everyone filled it out and then it would generate a dynamic leaderboard and you could see who got the most questions right. And we could all watch together and refresh on the page. And it's it was amazing. would have never been able to do that before. It took me probably two and a half hours and it was some of the most fun I've had in months.

Nad (55:17.358)
That's awesome. And I love those two examples as well because I'd actually blocked this out of my memory, whenever I going back almost 10, 15 years, I used to send greeting cards online to people because that was a dumb thing, but they were always riddled with ads. They were horrible. And so it's so good, but now you can just build something completely bespoke. It's yours. And we just don't even have to think about that.

---
### Creative applications: birthday cards and Super Bowl betting games as learning experiences

Ridd (55:43.71)
Yeah. Right, so we were touching on some of the AI native org, everything's up for grabs. How are you then reacting to that as someone who's, you had this blank slate of a design org to assemble. How does that impact the types of designers you're looking for, the traits that you want to prioritize, and even the way that you dream about how you all might work in the future?

Nad (56:10.542)
So I think one of the things that's unique at Lovable is that we hire probably more generalists than companies do generally. So we actually, most of the team, well maybe not most of the team, a good portion of the team is ex-founders. I'd say one thing that the entire team has in common is that everyone's really high agency. And so generally people have had slightly unusual backgrounds in some way, shape or form.

And so for example, Henrik, who runs our social media accounts, he got into social media because he used to run an Instagram account for the office, the US office that went completely viral, hundreds of thousands of followers. He started monetizing it as a teenager with merchandise and stuff like that. And so he just really deeply understands social media and has this maverick streak about him.

We on the design side, we're basically thinking about things the same way of hiring or finding people who are generalists, very high agency, don't necessarily think too much about here's the constraint of the box that I fit into. And also in some way have this maverick streak of just figuring things out for themselves.

---
### Hiring philosophy: seeking generalists, former founders, and high-agency individuals

Ridd (57:33.129)
I love the culture of former founders. That's about as fun as it gets in terms of generalists, everybody's wearing all the hats, we're all just figuring this out together. I gotta imagine this probably makes for a fun place to work.

Nad (57:45.103)
Yeah, for sure. I mean, the nice thing is that especially as a designer, it's not like, design is not waterfall here. So it's not like here's the perfect designs. I've thought through every single edge case, here you go. It means that we can collaborate and calibrate on the most important parts, which is what problems are we solving and why, and what's the overall philosophy and really sort of nail out more of the happy paths together. So that's super rewarding in itself.

But also just working with a lot of high agency individuals, everyone's just super smart and super driven. So the opportunity again for learning is just huge, which is great.

---
### Collaborative design culture and the benefits of working with founder-types

Ridd (58:28.287)
Any rituals or, I don't want to say processes, any other defining trait, I don't want to ask this. Basically I'm gonna give you a catch-all to just talk about. You know what, I guess even just pausing off the record, is there anything on your mind that we just haven't talked about that you definitely wanted to come up before we kind of land the plane?

Nad (58:53.122)
So we didn't really talk about designing for AI specifically, because I think one thing I want to talk about is, if you think it's interesting as well, is just what it means to, I guess we talked about design for AI earlier. There's one aspect that we didn't touch on, which is that the best AI solutions have this symbiotic relationship across the user, the models, the models context.

---
### The symbiotic relationship between users, models, and application architecture in AI products

Ridd (59:40.285)
Any other challenges or considerations that you're experiencing when designing for AI products specifically that maybe someone who's not in this type of field would be unaware of?

Nad (59:52.419)
Yes, I think one of the things that really surprised me is that there's a completely symbiotic relationship between the end user, the models, the context that the models have, and also how you build around the models, with the actual architecture of your own application as well. And this needs to work really well across the whole stack.

Really less abstract examples would be for lovable users, if you're trying to add a new feature to your app. The way that we handle that is through one entire code path and one entire model path, which is really different to if you're trying to fix a bug. And so I think in a lot of, one failure would be if we treated these things as technical problems where it's more the AI engineers are going to figure out what the AI, what context the AI models will have in these specific instances. And wherever we've succeeded, it's actually been a user experience problem. It's been, okay, what is the user trying to do in that exact moment?

What is their goal even before they launched the app? How are they breaking down tasks in terms of how big they are or how small they are and how are they navigating through that? And I think the best AI products that I've used are the best solutions really nail this sort of marriage of user goals to the individual implementations. And so I was really surprised at how symbiotic all of that is.

Actually whilst we had a wait list, so we had a wait list for around six to nine months before we did our big public launch, we did three major re-architectures where we almost deleted the entire app and started out again. And it's because we weren't happy with the core user flow, this core flow that users were going through as they were iterating on their apps. And we couldn't just edit the UX on one hand and think about AI on the other. We had to think about these things completely together.

---
### Designing for AI: treating user experience and AI implementation as unified problems

Ridd (01:01:47.712)
But it makes sense why it's so important to have things exist in code because it's the distance between the user experience and what exists in a static mock has never been wider.

Nad (01:02:00.728)
Yeah, 100%.

---
### The growing gap between static design mocks and live AI-powered experiences

Ridd (01:02:06.623)
Before I let you go, we've covered a lot of ground. Any parting ideas or advice or learnings that you want to leave people with who are interested in how you all are working as a team or even just what it's like to start to tinker and explore with AI?

Nad (01:02:26.636)
Yeah, I mean, I'd love to, I'd actually love to learn from others as well. So I think there's so much up for grabs right now that there's a few key products out there that are doing really amazing work. And I'd love to figure out which are the best AI products out there right now. And what is getting everyone else excited? We spoke briefly about granola, granola's turned how I think about even note taking upside down.

And so anything where there's an interesting intersection of users can actually behave in a different way now, thanks to products existing, would love to hear about.

Ridd (01:03:07.249)
Anything that's already on your list that you're taking inspiration from.

Nad (01:03:11.394)
I think granola is a really interesting one because the thing I love about granola as well is that the UX is so minimal. It's four or five small decisions made really well. And then that just empowers a bunch of different use cases. And it also forces you to change in a lot of ways. And I think actually historically, we've always said, reduce friction and sort of meet users where they are. Whereas with AI, we kind of need to invert that.

And it's not about meeting people where they are, it's about giving them superpowers. And Granola is one of those tools where I feel in lot of ways like I have superpowers.

---
### Learning from other AI products and the power of minimal, superpowering UX like Granola

Ridd (01:03:49.13)
Well, I've definitely felt that about Lovable too. Even just using the mobile site in a cafe, it just has become the new game that I play on my phone. So I appreciate all of the work that's went into it and you taking the time to share a little behind the scenes with us today.

Nad (01:04:04.878)
Great, I know you have real pleasure to meet and to talk.
