### Description Hook

Did you know that the very first interface designer at Adobe was also the first designer to work on Figma? ü§Ø

His name is [Andrei Herasimchuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreiherasimchuk/) and he knows a *lot* about design tooling‚Ä¶

So this week‚Äôs episode is jam-packed with stories about designing the earliest interfaces for Illustrator and Photoshop, as well as what it was like seeing the original seed of an idea that became Figma.

Not only that‚Ä¶ Andrei gives us a behind-the-scenes of his [new design tooling startup](https://www.seldon.digital/) and shares his vision for where software creation is headed next üëÄ

### Insights from the OG tool designer

**1 ‚Äî The fourth phase of design tooling**

1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Pixels

The Macintosh brought pixels into the mainstream with products like MacPaint Pro. This continued into the early 1990‚Äôs including the earliest versions of Photoshop.

2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Layers

In 1994 Photoshop 3 launched which ushered us into the ‚Äúlayers‚Äù era. All of a sudden you could do blend modes, transparency, etc.

3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Objects

Eventually products like Fireworks brought even greater functionality (ex: border radius, box shadows, new transforms, etc.). This tech continued to mature through Sketch and eventually Figma.

4Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äî Components (this is what Andrei believes is next)

A big part of Andrei‚Äôs vision for Seldon is figuring out how to make components that feel fluid (you know‚Ä¶ so you don‚Äôt cmd+opt+b them all day long).

Because this flexibility could open a lot of doors‚Ä¶

For starters, component-driven design tools unlock a higher ceiling for AI . This is because components are inherently semantic which makes it easier for an LLM to understand its role in a given design and make intelligent suggestions.

The more I talk to people building in this space the more clear it becomes that components have to be the foundation for AI. It‚Äôs no wonder why Figma invested in their simple design system leading up to 2024 Config.

The problem is that components in Figma aren‚Äôt really components‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre ‚Äúobjects‚Äù meant to mimic code components. That‚Äôs where the rigidity comes from (and why my slot components breakdown is my most popular tutorial ever).

The fourth phase of design is where components become flexible, expressive, and built directly into the tool itself.

**2 ‚Äî AI will introduce new interaction paradigms**
AI is going to fundamentally change how we think about the inputs in our design process‚Ä¶

> ‚Äúyou could drop in a whole PRD, combine it with a couple of sketches and the recent data from your research team‚Ä¶ AI can process all this‚Äù
> 
- Andrei Herasimchuk

But that‚Äôs just the start‚Ä¶

For a long time we‚Äôve lived in a paradigm where your layer list is on the left and your properties are on the right, but Andrei thinks AI is going to disrupt that üëÄ

> ‚ÄúAI is a paradigm shift the same way in that the mouse, when it came out to manipulate and draw pixels on a computer screen, was an entirely new interaction paradigm‚Äù
> 
- Andrei Herasimchuk

The mouse meant that all of a sudden you have new buttons and types of interactions (ex: click and drag). As a result the early painting apps had wildly different interfaces. Because nobody really knew what they were doing yet   üòÖ

Andrei believes we‚Äôre about to enter a similar era in design tools.

---

**3 ‚Äî The three types of designers in the future**
Andrei believes AI will eventually split the industry into a few buckets:

1. Designers who tend to be more business-oriented with a focus on higher level positioning. These people will begin to blend with traditional product management roles.
2. Designers who tend to be more qualitatively-driven and enjoy getting into the weeds of how people use the product. This is where traditional UX people live these days.
3. Designers who build the actual components . Notice I used the word ‚Äúbuild‚Äù not ‚Äúdesign‚Äù. These people will have to bring a pretty technical skillset to the table (Andrei uses the term ‚Äúdesign engineer‚Äù).

Andrei compares this final bucket to modern day typographers. In the same way that most teams use existing typography, we‚Äôll have a lot of existing components to choose from and they‚Äôll be built directly into our tools. That means the people building them will be more niche craftsman vs. a role that exists on every team.

### Ridd‚Äôs Brain dump

I like entering the fourth era of design tools because it makes people wonder what the previous three were and creates a curiosity gap about what is coming next. It's this peak into the future and we get to talk about where things are headed through the lens of somebody who has been there and is actively shaping that future. The description hook is excellent because it starts off with a fun fact by asking a question, almost a little piece of trivia. I think that's one of the most engaging ways that you can start a hook is by asking a question because it sucks people in and immediately gets their brain thinking about what the answer might be. I like the phrase jam packed in the description too. That's language that I lean on quite often. I like how I end on shares his vision for where software creation is headed next, again getting that futuristic lens going. For the description highlights, I think there are some pieces that I really like. For instance, the bizarre story of Andre's first day at Adobe is really good that gets people curious. The three types of designers that will exist in the future, again hitting on that strategy of using lists and making people wonder what's on them. I think that works well. The number one trade of designers he's worked with over the last three decades is excellent too because it makes people really curious about what that trait might be while still being very specific about what you will get out of the episode. As far as the newsletter info goes, phase four is interesting because again it doesn't mean anything in isolation but then after you read the email you understand why the title is phase four and as a high level pattern that's something that I like. Just pulling out one really specific thing from the content that doesn't actually say a whole lot on its own and people might wonder what it means. I do think there's probably a more interesting title that we could have pulled other than phase four. It's not that curiosity inducing. For the subtitle, I don't often make the titles, in this case both the alternative title and the newsletter subtitle about the person's role because it's pretty rare that somebody would have such an interesting title that people would want to tune in just for who they are. In this case the fact that they were the first designer at Adobe was very interesting. Another example of this is the head of design at cursor. That's one of the hottest startups in the world. Saying that carries a lot of weight but sometimes that's not the case. As far as the key takeaway goes, I think anytime that we can write lists that are actually engaging it's almost always a good idea. The three types of designers in the future, everybody's going to read that or at least give it because you wonder what those types are and also organizing a takeaway into a list like this just makes it easier to consume so it's a win-win.
