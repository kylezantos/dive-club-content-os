### 🎙️ Macro Market Shift: The Rise of Fractional Design

The first idea is kinda market level, and a few different things are happening.

One, AI is making everyone much more efficient.

Companies are smaller.

Good designers will be able to accomplish much more in a much smaller amount of time—especially if you loop in Pietro Schirano's idea about designers wielding agents to scale their impact as an IC.

The other thing that’s happening is AI is gonna make it much easier to maintain projects over time.

There’s less maintenance work to be done.

As a result, designers might not have to work in one company.

There might not even be a need to—and that’s gonna lead to this fracturing of the talent landscape a little bit.

Ten years ago, there was extreme concentration in a handful of companies.

But now with AI—another kind of third angle to this—is that as the cost of software gets lower, there’s this explosion of new ideas, new kinds of zero-to-one opportunities.

So those projects need design thinking.

They need design expertise in order to stand out and succeed.

I don’t think that there’s a contraction of demand for design.

If anything, there’s an increase—as the surface area requiring design expands.

### 🎙️ Fractional Work as a Designer’s Ideal Mode

Gabe’s thesis that I agree with is: the best designers are going to be able to work fractionally, where they give their services to multiple companies simultaneously.

They scratch the creative itch.

They avoid the more mundane maintenance and optimization work.

And even at a higher level, you’re able to position yourself to focus on just the things that you’re best at—and that are most life-giving for you.

So for Gabe, that’s the zero-to-one work.

I can include a quote about how he designs for the love of the game, and he just loves the process.

He doesn’t really care about having this end artifact or end company or thing that he can point at.

He likes the process and the craft of design—and just doing it over and over and over again.

That’s what’s motivating for him.

So in a fractional world, he’s able to just focus on that one thing.

That’s one big bucket of an idea: the macro landscape for fractional design.

And I even personally have noticed an uptick in really skilled people who are far along in their career making this jump.

### 🎙️ A Role for Specialists: Fractional Systems Consultants

I could also loop in Dan Weiner’s idea about how he thinks there’s an opportunity for a fractional designer who specializes in design systems—to help teams be able to take advantage of AI coding.

That idea connects here.

### 🎙️ Tooling for Independence

Another thing that’s interesting is how a lot of us are just gonna build our own internal tools that are tailor-made for the set of problems that we have.

And if you’re going independent, that’s a theme I’ve noticed a lot.

So Gabe’s built his freelance OS that includes everything that he needs.

### 🎙️ Positioning Fractional Work: "Design Cofounder as a Service"

There’s also an interesting idea here about how Gabe positions and sells the value of fractional design.

Just because it economically makes sense, you still have to know how to sell it.

So he kind of thinks of himself as a **design cofounder as a service**—and there’s a pretty good quote.

He’s positioning against certain alternatives:

- You could hire a full-time person, which is hard and expensive and challenging.
- You could hire an agency, which is very expensive and also really rigid in the way that they work.
- You could hire a contractor, but that forces the leadership to really scope the project and figure things out.

**Or you can hire Gabe**—and he positions himself as a design cofounder as a service where *you don’t even have to know what you need*.

We’ll figure it out together and partner strategically on what the end result should be.
