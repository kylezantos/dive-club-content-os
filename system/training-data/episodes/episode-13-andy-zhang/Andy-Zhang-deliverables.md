### Description Hook

Did you know that one of the most fascinating design engineers I've encountered started his journey by spending two hours debating whether a button should say "delete" or "remove"? Andy Zhang was a Figma intern back in 2015 when the company had fewer than 10 people, and his story perfectly illustrates how transformational early experiences can shape an entirely new category of professional. What's particularly impressive about Andy's path is how he's created his own role by following curiosity rather than traditional career ladders—transitioning from software engineering to product management to design engineering, ultimately joining Windsurf (which got acquired by Google) through a conversation with a basketball teammate.

### Description Highlights

- The specific moment in 2015 when a friend in his living room introduced him to Figma (before most people had even heard of it)
- How Rasmus spent an entire lunch break deconstructing Go compilers over chocolate, teaching Andy that design and engineering excellence aren't mutually exclusive
- The fascinating "water in the cup" philosophy Andy uses to fill gaps between engineering and design at a 20-person startup
- His LLM-inspired approach to design decisions where he maximizes context before making any moves (and why this changes everything about hybrid roles)
- The counterintuitive reason why he focuses on patterns over features, and how degrees of freedom thinking helps him build scalable systems
- a *lot* more

### Key Takeaways

## 3 highlights from my interview with Andy

**1 — Formative experiences compound faster than you think**

Andy's 2015 Figma internship wasn't just another summer job—it was a masterclass in curiosity-driven work culture. With fewer than 10 people on the team, he had direct access to Dylan Field, Rasmus Andersson, and Evan Wallace during their most formative building phase. His mentor Jessica didn't just assign him tasks; she probed what genuinely excited him and aligned projects with his interests. This shifted his entire mindset from "what do I need to work on" to "what do I want to work on."

> "I can see the Delta in my excitement and how much work I poured into or how much thought I put into my work once I was aligned or my work was aligned with my interests."

The obsessive attention to detail was infectious—Andy watched Rasmus spend two hours debating "delete" versus "remove" using physical analogies, which expanded his understanding of what true craft looks like. These weren't isolated incidents but the cultural norm that shaped his approach to building products.

**2 — Hybrid roles emerge from solving real problems, not job descriptions**

Andy joined Windsurf as a "growth engineer" but quickly realized the company had design gaps nobody was addressing systematically. Instead of waiting for permission or a formal role change, he began identifying and solving these problems until his scope naturally expanded to own both product design and significant parts of the engineering system. This taught him that design engineers become valuable by being indispensable, not by fitting into predefined boxes.

> "In the process of seeing a lot of the problems of the company, I came to the conclusion that a design engineer was what was best for the company."

His "water in the cup" philosophy perfectly captures this approach—while other engineers are the rocks and sand, he fills the gaps wherever they exist. Sometimes that's pure engineering for bug fixes, sometimes it's design systems work, and sometimes it's coordinating parallel threads to accelerate shipping velocity.

---

**3 — Context maximization beats specialization in complex systems**

Andy's most surprising insight is how he approaches complex design decisions using an "LLM-like" process where he maximizes available context before making moves. He works backwards from the optimal decision, asking: How much of the engineering system do I need to understand? What do users actually know about these product types? How do competitors handle this? What are the invariants versus degrees of freedom in our system?

> "What I try to think about is how can I maximize the amount of context possible that I have to make the best decision?"

This approach helps him balance forward-thinking pattern creation with rapid iteration needs. By understanding which elements of their AI-powered system won't change (tokens in, tokens out; user messages and tool calls structure) versus what's flexible, he can design extensible patterns that accommodate unknowns while staying grounded in system realities.
