# Episode 16: Escha Vera Deliverables v2

## Main Title + Alternatives

- **Primary:** How to become a designer who treats AI as throughput, not output
- **Alt 1:** Designing beyond the pixels with AI as your creative collaborator
- **Alt 2:** The designer who generates planets, composes music, and builds browser experiences that feel magical
- **Alt 3:** Entering the age of designers who ship experiences, not just deliverables

## Hook

What if I told you there's a designer at Perplexity who doesn't just create mockups—she generates 3D planets for onboarding flows, collaborates with music producers to craft browser soundtracks, and trains her own AI models to create thousands of unique invite cards? Escha Vera represents something I've been studying closely: the transition from traditional design deliverables to designing entire *experiences* using AI as creative throughput. She's the poster child for breaking out of the box of what designers think design deliverables should be—and her approach at Perplexity reveals exactly how the most innovative companies are giving designers the creative freedom to reimagine what's possible.

**Title:** throughput, not output

**Subtitle:** How one designer is redefining deliverables by treating AI as creative collaborator

## Highlights

- How she uses AI as "throughput not output"—combining dozens of iterations across multiple tools to create something the world's never seen before
- The messy creative process behind Comet's rotating planet onboarding (involving texture mapping, Perplexity Labs, and 360-degree video exports)
- Why she collaborates with music producer Nesso to create browser soundtracks—and how Suno helps her express ideas in musical form before sending stems to human collaborators
- Her end-to-end workflow for building generative invite systems using Midjourney, Photoshop, CivitAI, and FAL AI to create 10,000+ unique variations
- The "What if we did this?" → "Cool, do it" culture at Perplexity that enables this level of creative experimentation
- a *lot* more

## Key Takeaways

### 3 highlights from my interview with Escha

**1 — Use AI as throughput, not output—embrace the messy creative process**

One of the most impressive things I've seen in AI-assisted design is Escha's approach to treating AI results as raw material rather than final deliverables. She might combine things dozens of times before getting to the final result, moving back and forth between Figma, Photoshop, and Midjourney in iterative cycles.

> "Using my own art as inputs, using my own art as fodder for a model, using images from that model as inputs. Taking that output and continuing to iterate and remix that. Take that output, put it in as another input along with two other inputs. Really not just sticking to type words, hit go, but doing a bunch of what you would normally do as an artist."

This isn't the slot machine approach where you prompt once and hope for magic. It's about rolling up your sleeves, experimenting with tool combinations, and forging entirely new workflows. The rotating planet in Comet's onboarding? That started with a branded texture, went through Perplexity Labs for 3D generation, became a 360-degree video, and ended up as the centerpiece of one of the most memorable browser onboarding experiences I've ever encountered.

**2 — Design beyond the pixels—contribute to how products *feel***

Escha represents a fundamental shift in what design deliverables can be. While most designers stop at screens and prototypes, she's contributing to how Comet *feels* through planets, music, and generative systems that create thousands of unique variations.

> "It's not about how little can you do, it's about how much more can you do because of AI as a tool within your workflow, whether it's at the beginning, the middle, the end."

Her collaboration with producer Nesso resulted in the Comet theme song titled "Waking Up Before Everyone Else at the Sleepover and the Wii is still on"—a perfect encapsulation of the nostalgic, magical feeling they wanted to create. She even uses Suno to generate musical ideas and send stems to human collaborators, creating entirely new creative workflows. Her generative invite system produces 10,000+ unique variations by training custom models and building complex generation pipelines. This is what happens when designers think beyond traditional deliverables and start designing entire experiences.

**3 — Create space for creative experimentation—the autonomy advantage**

The reason Escha can work in these revolutionary ways comes down to Perplexity's culture of creative freedom. When she comes to the table with "What if we did this?" ideas, the response is consistently "Cool, do it."

> "High autonomy, high ownership, high responsibility, high impact. The design team in general is just given so much trust to not just propose a design solution, but to actually help implement the thing."

This isn't just nice-to-have creative freedom—it's strategically essential for companies that want to leverage AI's full creative potential. You can't innovate with these tools if every experiment requires committee approval. Escha's work proves that when you give talented designers the autonomy to explore, experiment, and ship, they'll create experiences that feel genuinely magical rather than just functionally adequate. The key is creating cultural conditions where "What if?" questions lead to action, not endless discussion.
