### Key Takeaways

What does it take to create a product worthy of winning Mac app of the year?

I interviewed the founder of Craft Docs, Balint Orosz, to find out.

Here are a few of the things that stood out to me üëá

---

**1 ‚Äî Mobile first**

Balint intentionally started with a mobile app (remember how Play made a similar decision ?). This ensured they created the simplest possible solution.

---

**2 ‚Äî Personalization**

With their latest Craft 3 release, the team is saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to B2B and focusing 100% on consumer.

So many of their experiments have been about finding fun ways to make Craft feel like home for users. As a result you get wildly different UIs depending on how you use it (which I find awesome).

Craft can be black and white text or a colorful personal Pinterest. Which presents a ton of unique design challenges.

I may or may not have spent last night in Figma trying to find ways to bring this level of personalization into the product I‚Äôm designing üòÖ

---

**3 ‚Äî Figma = sketching**

They think about Figma as the initial phase of ‚Äúsketching‚Äù . This means more often than not they have significant changes happen while a design is brought to life in code.

Part of this is because the design of Craft is so heavily influenced by the content. But it also forces designers and engineers to work closely and explore ideas in tandem.

Balint also mentioned how there‚Äôs a pretty wide spectrum of technical savvy on the design team . Some designers are more than comfortable polishing things in code but it‚Äôs not necessary. Either way, engineers are encouraged to write code that designers can easily read.

---

**4 ‚Äî Unique approach to design systems**

Craft invests in a system for speed but it looks prettttty different than you might expect.

They don‚Äôt focus on atomic components at all . Instead they systematize things like their animation engine and theming. That way it‚Äôs very easy to:

- Animate 25 elements on a screen all at once
- Inherit the ‚Äúglowing‚Äù effect of a gradient background material
- Add a gradient fader on top of a text label with a single line of code

You know what you won‚Äôt find in their system though? A button component.

And Balint admits you might find a lack of standardization here and there but this is how they feel they can most quickly create green field projects.

---

**5 ‚Äî Ownership and experimentation**

Craft has two roadmaps:

1. Two weeks
2. One year

This creates a lot of space for reacting to customer feedback but also for experimentation. Which means designers have a ton of ownership at Craft.

You‚Äôre expected to experiment with things like LLMs, creating your own washi tape , and even shaders !

And after a week or two you report back to the team and make a case for whether Craft should continue to ‚Äúfund‚Äù your experiment.

6 ‚Äî #1 trait

I asked Balint ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the #1 trait you look for in designers?‚Äù

His answer üëâ systems thinking

There‚Äôs a lot more where that came from‚Ä¶

We go deep into how they work and what it takes to achieve an award-winning level of design excellence.

### Ridd‚Äôs Brain dump

 I really like the title because the what it takes implies that you're going to learn something specific by listening to the episode, but the award-winning product also speaks to the credibility of the person that you're going to be listening to. And being able to achieve both of those goals in a single title is hard, but I think that's what makes for a good title here. Getting Mac App of the Year is a good title too just because it is a catchy visual for a YouTube thumbnail. The other two, Design Excellence at Kraft Docs and the Ultimate Design Lead Culture, are pretty weak though, in my opinion. As far as the hook goes, I think it's great because it asks a question. It creates a curiosity gap right away because you want to know how did they win the awards? What did they know that I don't know? So that's really effective. I think it probably could be a little bit longer. Maybe there's something that I could do to explain what Kraft Docs is a bit. That's the only way that I can improve this. As far as the description goes, I think it's good. I like the behind the scenes of the viral quick ad feature. It feels like there's a story there. What balance looks for in systems thinker is good because it's always nice to highlight potential growth areas or boxes that people can check. They want to hear something and be like, "Oh yeah, I bring that to the table." That's a good feeling that we can give people. For the newsletter, the title is Perfect. It's very unique. It'll stand out from every other email, subject line that you're getting. You have no idea what it means, but you kind of want to know what it means. Then the subtitle very clearly enforces what you're going to get out of reading it, which is a perfect one-two punch that I'm always trying to strive for. The key takeaway is great because it's all about what they're doing that is unique. It's like, "Hey, everybody's doing this thing a certain way, but Kraft has a totally unique approach to design systems." Obviously, it's working because they have a really high quality product that's one awards, so you should pay attention to what they are doing differently because they might know some sort of a secret that the rest of the industry doesn't. This is your opportunity to learn that secret.
