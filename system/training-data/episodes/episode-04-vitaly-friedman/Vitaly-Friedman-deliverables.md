### Description Hook

I’m willing to bet that you have been on [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/?utm_source=dive-club.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=slow-is-smooth-smooth-is-fast&_bhlid=e59cacc31e706d216f99d3d8fc5847d9396cd43e) at some point in the last 18 years…

Their founder, [Vitaly Friedman](https://x.com/vitalyf?lang=en&utm_source=dive-club.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=slow-is-smooth-smooth-is-fast&_bhlid=24aa822921168db2dbf69e16a07447a9562ee76e), has been one of the leading thinkers in UX for decades. And right now he’s obsessing over how we can design AI experiences that people love using.

So this week’s episode is a masterclass in design patterns for AI (read: lots of screen-sharing 👀).

We dissect products like [Consensus](https://consensus.app/?utm_source=dive-club.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=slow-is-smooth-smooth-is-fast&_bhlid=8f7c299817fb2c69598194fbc2d43a9854cada59), [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/?utm_source=dive-club.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=slow-is-smooth-smooth-is-fast&_bhlid=b391b351a02987de526c5976445e7ccbc951e684), [Elicit](https://elicit.com/?utm_source=dive-club.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=slow-is-smooth-smooth-is-fast&_bhlid=208a160d6356b701ba33ce5d64cd386ce6967ca3), and many more to figure out what’s missing and what can be improved.

### Key takeaways about AI design patterns

**1 — Helping users slow down**
I worked with a contractor on my home for a year and he would always say the same phrase: “Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast” .

I think this applies to designing AI products as well 😅

Vitaly’s goal is to make sure that before anybody sends a prompt, it’s “so succinct, so accurate, so useful, so detailed, so contextual” that the chance of getting a generic, unhelpful response is minimal.

That means actively slowing people down before they attempt to generate an output with AI.

Skilled prompters would never open a new chat and say “make me a ______”.

They would probably say something like: “My goal is to make a _______. I’m going to include some context, and then I’d like you to ask me as many questions as needed to ensure you have everything required to nail the task”.

So how do we bake that understanding into the UX itself?

The good news is we already have some tried and true patterns for doing exactly that👇

**2 — Leveraging familiar UI patterns**
The internet is a sea of open-ended text boxes right now.

Proven UI patterns are strangely absent in AI interfaces, even though they’ve been table stakes in SaaS for years.

It’s a big reason why Vitaly is such a fan of Consensus . They layer familiar affordances around the core chat interface that really improve the UX (like a filter panel for instance).

They also go further with ideas like quantifiably representing sources in a “Consensus Meter” and creating UIs to filter by type. These patterns make results more useful and help users feel in control.

Vitaly shares about 20 more examples of little patterns like this in the full video 😅

**3 — Dynamic loading states**
Loading states are more important than ever because this is the first time it actually makes sense to have a 10–20 second wait in your product.

So how can we use that downtime to help users add context and set the model up for success?

It reminds me of something the Head of Design at Gamma shared : in the early days while presentation outlines were loading, they gave users theming options to customize the output. This eliminated the feeling of waiting and turned a dead moment into progress.

How many other AI products could take advantage of this same moment?

Based on the initial prompt, the AI could assemble a UI to clarify the user’s intent.

Maybe that includes sliders, a number rating scale, a follow-up question, etc. All of this could be done with simple, predictable components.

Done right, these micro-flows would keep people engaged and level up the quality of AI interactions.

So if you enjoy getting nerdy on patterns like this then this episode will probably be one of your favorites yet 👇

### Ridd’s Brain dump

I like the title a lot. Beyond Chat is very specific. Again, it creates that curiosity gap of what might be there. And it plays well with the phrase "what's next?" In general, anytime that we are looking into the future and talking about where things are added, how to adapt, where to invest, that type of title works pretty consistently when the episode subject matter matches. As far as the hook goes, I think it's better than average. The first sentence isn't a boring description. It's got a little bit of jab and punch to it, and then it immediately goes into selling the tally as someone who is worth listening to. And I like how it talks in specifics about what makes this episode unique with lots of screen sharing and making the whole thing feel very practical. I think the description highlights are very good. I like lines like, "Why more products should be AI second, not AI first?" It's a bit contradictory. It lends itself to the fact that there might be a spicy take in here somewhere, which I think is always good. You don't want these to feel bland and expected. But you also don't want them to feel over the top and clickbaity, because that just feels cringe. And I think this is a nice middle ground. I like the newsletter title because it's unexpected, and in general, I think the subject lines should stand out and maybe make people scratch their head a bit, wondering what that could be referring to. For the key takeaway, I really like the personal angle and how the quotes are woven into the paragraph itself. I also really like how the last sentence tees up the next paragraph, too.
