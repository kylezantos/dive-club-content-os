  },
  "quality_markers": {
    "depth_indicators": [...],
    "specificity_requirements": [...],
    "transformation_language": [...]
  }
}
```

**Statistical Summaries**

Provide quantified guidance:
- Optimal title length ranges

### Pattern Validation

Ensure patterns appear in 3+ episodes before inclusion:
- Cross-reference with original data
- Validate frequency claims
- Confirm distinctiveness vs. generic content
- Test actionability of guidelines

### Template Testing Framework

For each template, provide:
- **Input Variables**: What needs to be customized
- **Output Example**: Sample generated content
- **Voice Verification**: How to check authenticity
