    "One of the most impressive things I’ve seen a designer make all year is [Meng To’s Dreamcut](https://x.com/MengTo/status/1848669694800367901).\n\nIt’s the perfect example of what it looks like to transition from traditional designer to *builder 💪* So if you’re interested in becoming a designer who ships then this is the episode for you.\n\nMeng gives a highly practical breakdown of what it looks like to go from 0 to 50,000+ lines of code as a designer. And Meng is the *perfect* person to onboard you into tools like Claude and Cursor because he’s spent 10+ years teaching designers how to code through [Design+Code](https://designcode.io/).",

      "title": "1 — Be an enabler not a bottleneck",
      "content": "Too many designers operate in a waterfall mentality where things are either “designed” or “not designed”.\n\nBut when you’re growing at the speed of Lovable you can’t afford to position yourself as the keeper of all design decisions . So Nad is more than comfortable letting engineers carry things end-to-end when possible.\n\n> “My job is to enable higher quality decisions across the board rather than making all those decisions myself and then waterfalling them onto the team”\n> \n- Nad Chishtie\n\nThis means Nad thinks of quality as debt rather than a bar to hit. When you’re the first designer you have to be ok shipping some features with “design debt” to be paid off later.\n\n---"

    {
      "title": "2 — Getting feedback uncomfortably fast",
      "content": "Nad stresses the importance of not falling in love with your ideas (a theme Sam from Granola echoed last week too).\n\nBecause they’re going to be wrong.\n\nThe times Lovable has “failed” have been when they tried to be too visionary. Now the focus is on reducing iteration cycles and getting feedback “uncomfortably fast”.\n\n> “How do we maximize our learning in the shortest scale possible? What that means is lots of rapid, scrappy experimentation and lots of being willing to be wrong”\n> \n- Nad Chishtie\n\nTo accomplish this, Lovable puts a lot of weight on velocity of decision-making. Nad calls it having a high “clock speed” ⚡\n\n> “What stops you from making a 10-second version of that decision on the spot instead of waiting for a meeting next week?”\n> \n- Nad Chishtie\n\n---"

      "title": "1️⃣ Coding was a red herring",
      "content": "There used to be a holy war over whether or not designers should spend time and energy learning how to code.\n\nBut it turns out coding was a little bit of a red herring. Instead Soleio segments designers into two buckets:\n\nDesigners who can ship real product\n\nDesigners who create concept cars and blueprints\n\nIf that makes you uncomfortable or sparks a bit of conviction… I’m right there with ya 😅 but the fact is that tools like Cursor and Claude (remember, Joel ?) have lowered the bar to the point where we no longer have any excuse.\n\n> “Designers who are not shipping are running out of excuses”\n> \n- Soleio\n\nHere’s the thing though… if anyone can create software then design will become an even greater differentiator. And I’m feeling incredibly grateful to bring design as a core skill into the future.\n\nAt Facebook in the early days they used to have a saying: “the quick shall inherit the earth”. Well there’s nobody faster than a designer who can ship."

  "brain_dumps": [
    "How to build your ideas with AI is a good title because it's very practical. It makes it feel like you're going to learn something. Like it almost might be a little bit more like a tutorial than an interview. And again, how to is almost always worth including in the options of titles. Unless we use it too often, in which case it can become a little bit redundant. But in isolation, I think it's a fairly effective format. I think this description hook is really good because it immediately makes you want to see what dream cut is. Because saying something like, \"If this is one of the most impressive things I've seen a designer make all year,\" is a pretty bold statement that carries some weight. There's another phrase that works really well in the description, which is, \"Transition from traditional designer to builder.\" And this gets at that aspirational idea where people are coming to dive club because they want some kind of a transformation in their career. They want to grow. And so this episode does a good job of very clearly articulating what that growth will be from listening and reinforcing it throughout all of the messaging. The phrase, \"Highly practical breakdown\" in the hook is quite nice too. Any time I can highlight the fact that the episode is tactical and not fluffy, I want to do it when it makes sense. The description is good, not great. The one that is very good is the secret to an effective first-time promise. Because it feels like a very specific thing that you're learning. As far as the newsletter goes, I think the subtitle is good because it implies that the content is practical. The title, the newest design tool, is kind of lame. It's really clear what it's going to be about. It might actually present itself as not interesting for someone and they would choose to not read this because it's almost too obvious what the content is about. But it's not gripping, really. It's not bad, but it's not great. For the key takeaway, I think the title is great. How to structure a first-time promise, super practical. I also like that it very specifically walks through Meng's experience in detail. I want the content to feel like we're getting into the weeds and getting very specific about things. feel like we're skimming the surface ever.",
    "I like the title a lot. Beyond Chat is very specific. Again, it creates that curiosity gap of what might be there. And it plays well with the phrase \"what's next?\" In general, anytime that we are looking into the future and talking about where things are added, how to adapt, where to invest, that type of title works pretty consistently when the episode subject matter matches. As far as the hook goes, I think it's better than average. The first sentence isn't a boring description. It's got a little bit of jab and punch to it, and then it immediately goes into selling the tally as someone who is worth listening to. And I like how it talks in specifics about what makes this episode unique with lots of screen sharing and making the whole thing feel very practical. I think the description highlights are very good. I like lines like, \"Why more products should be AI second, not AI first?\" It's a bit contradictory. It lends itself to the fact that there might be a spicy take in here somewhere, which I think is always good. You don't want these to feel bland and expected. But you also don't want them to feel over the top and clickbaity, because that just feels cringe. And I think this is a nice middle ground. I like the newsletter title because it's unexpected, and in general, I think the subject lines should stand out and maybe make people scratch their head a bit, wondering what that could be referring to. For the key takeaway, I really like the personal angle and how the quotes are woven into the paragraph itself. I also really like how the last sentence tees up the next paragraph, too.",
    "I like entering the fourth era of design tools because it makes people wonder what the previous three were and creates a curiosity gap about what is coming next. It's this peak into the future and we get to talk about where things are headed through the lens of somebody who has been there and is actively shaping that future. The description hook is excellent because it starts off with a fun fact by asking a question, almost a little piece of trivia. I think that's one of the most engaging ways that you can start a hook is by asking a question because it sucks people in and immediately gets their brain thinking about what the answer might be. I like the phrase jam packed in the description too. That's language that I lean on quite often. I like how I end on shares his vision for where software creation is headed next, again getting that futuristic lens going. For the description highlights, I think there are some pieces that I really like. For instance, the bizarre story of Andre's first day at Adobe is really good that gets people curious. The three types of designers that will exist in the future, again hitting on that strategy of using lists and making people wonder what's on them. I think that works well. The number one trade of designers he's worked with over the last three decades is excellent too because it makes people really curious about what that trait might be while still being very specific about what you will get out of the episode. As far as the newsletter info goes, phase four is interesting because again it doesn't mean anything in isolation but then after you read the email you understand why the title is phase four and as a high level pattern that's something that I like. Just pulling out one really specific thing from the content that doesn't actually say a whole lot on its own and people might wonder what it means. I do think there's probably a more interesting title that we could have pulled other than phase four. It's not that curiosity inducing. For the subtitle, I don't often make the titles, in this case both the alternative title and the newsletter subtitle about the person's role because it's pretty rare that somebody would have such an interesting title that people would want to tune in just for who they are. In this case the fact that they were the first designer at Adobe was very interesting. Another example of this is the head of design at cursor. That's one of the hottest startups in the world. Saying that carries a lot of weight but sometimes that's not the case. As far as the key takeaway goes, I think anytime that we can write lists that are actually engaging it's almost always a good idea. The three types of designers in the future, everybody's going to read that or at least give it because you wonder what those types are and also organizing a takeaway into a list like this just makes it easier to consume so it's a win-win.",
    "I think the title is nice. Taste was definitely a buzzword that was attractive. So understanding that that was the word to orient around made a lot of sense. The description hook is really good because it sells Tiago and makes him seem quite interesting and worth listening to in a way that's pretty unique. I particularly like the line about how I've studied his visual techniques for many years because there's a personal element to it then. Nothing stands out in the description highlights. I think they are good, not great. The newsletter title is pretty bland, so I don't think that's a good example of what to look for. Similarly, the key takeaway that resonated. This was before I started really making these a first class citizen, so I think it's fine, but it's not something that is particularly insightful. I think the strongest part of this episode is the title and the hook.",
    "Why UX design is dead is to click baby for my taste. It performed well, but I think that it's pretty cringe. And in general, I want to avoid hyperbolic statements like that. However, the main title, harsh truths that designers need to hear, I think is excellent because it creates this curiosity gap where you want to know, wait, what are the words those harsh truths? As far as the description hook goes, this is definitely very weak. I mostly gave up and just wrote the facts of who Meg was without trying to grip someone in the first sentence. So I think this is a pretty good example of what not to do. The description highlights though are great. They're specific. They create curiosity gaps and things like common portfolio review mistakes make you want to see what the list is.",
    "This is another format for a title that I use from time to time. And it's basically listing three keywords, hoping that one of them will catch someone's attention. So in this case, it's prototyping, interaction design, and SwiftUI. I've done that in the past with some success. We just have to make sure that each keyword is actually compelling. I also really like the alternative title, Advanced Prototyping, because again, it gets at that level of seniority and implied intelligence of the audience where we're going really deep into things. We're not skimming the surface on topics. This isn't clickbait. This is learning in depth and substance. Now the description hook is very bad. It's incredibly boring, and I obviously did not put much thought into it. So this is a good example of what I don't want to do, because it's just stating the facts without having that first sentence that does something to pull the reader in. The description is fine. It's nothing special. I do like the newsletter title a lot, Expert Mode. It's specific. You don't know what it refers to, and I reinforce it later on in the email, in the content itself. Thank you.",
    "I like this title because it immediately makes people wonder what the new way is. Almost like they're missing out on something or there's some new arbitrage opportunity in the way that people work or a new unlock that they should be aware of. The alternative title, \"How to Become a Builder with AI is Strong 2\" because it implies a practicality and also gets at that idea of a transformation and personal growth. The hook is not great. There's no real attention grabber. Although I do like the personal angle about how I talked about lovable becoming the go-to way that I personally build my ideas. I feel strong because it's like an endorsement right out of the gate, but this still could be improved. As far as the description goes, I really like the specificity of the building and deleting the Figma-like layers panel because it's like, \"Oh, there's an interesting story there.\" The newsletter title is not great. I could have come up with something more interesting and arbitrary. This kind of spoils the joke by explaining exactly what the content is going to be about. The takeaway is really strong because I talk about how I would do something normally and then how NAD suggested a better way, which that format is really, really good. I do think that this takeaway is much shorter than I would have liked though. Ideally, I would beef this up a bit or add more content somewhere.",
    "I think the titles are great. I'm always tempted to use things like the new era, but it's easy to do that too much. But even the secondary title, where it talks about the rise of designers who ship or becoming a designer who ships, it speaks to the transformation. And that's what people are here listening to achieve. They want to grow. They want to get better. They want to have some kind of a transformation professionally. And so anytime that the title can lend itself to that, I think that's a win. I think the hook is just fine. It's a little bit unique because it's one of the only repeat guests, so this format isn't super applicable to other episodes. The highlights are strong. \"Little traits\" as a leading phrase makes a lot of sense because again, you want to know what that list is. I also like what you can do to invest in your future founder journey today, hints at there being very practical takeaways inside of the episode. And then the why we won't use smartphones the same way five years from now is also really effective because everybody always likes futuristic predictions too. The title for the newsletter is very good. It's one of my favorites actually because it's super ambiguous. You don't know what it's about. But then when you read the takeaway, you realize that it is pulling out a phrase that was used in the takeaway. So the title of the takeaway is \"Coding Was a Red Herring\" and so you don't understand what the title means for the newsletter until you get to that takeaway and then it clicks. And I love creating that. Anytime there's a unique or kind of quirky phrase from one of the takeaways that I can then turn into the subject line, I always try to do that. The key takeaway is really strong too because it leads with a belief that is well understood and then says why it was wrong. And that's always going to be a winning formula when you can say something that is a bit counterintuitive.",
