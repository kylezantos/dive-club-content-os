Dive (00:00.438)
So I want to imagine this person that has listened to a few episodes and they're like, do I have influence? Like, how do I know if I have influence? So what are the measuring sticks that you look at when you're evaluating influence?

Catt Small (00:18.348)
Yes, so when it comes to influence, I am usually thinking about a couple of things. One thing is trust. So you can usually tell if somebody trusts you, if they are, for example, consulting you for feedback on things. that's one example of a signal that you have influence. A lot of it, honestly, there are going to be signals that you are influential. So one of them is,

leaders, for example, coming to you, asking questions of you, it is leaders actually taking your ideas seriously and saying, you know, oh, that's really helpful. Those are little signals that you are building trust and what we call social capital. And social capital is essentially the, it's like a measurement that, you know, it's a framework of sorts where essentially you're measuring.

the currency of your relationships, your social relationships. And so when you have more social capital, then you can actually

kind of be more vulnerable and share more ideas. And then if you don't have a lot of social capital, then people are not gonna respond to your ideas as well. So you can think of social capital as also a way of measuring your influence. But other signals, for example, are that your ideas travel without you. So when I was interviewing Micah Bennett for my book, Staff Designer, Micah...

pointed this out actually, and I thought it was a really cool way to refer to how influential I am. So if people come to me later, like I, maybe I wasn't in the room, but somebody mentioned an idea that I mentioned to them. And then that other person, you know, there's other people in the room who come to me later and they're like, Hey, I heard that you had this idea. Can you tell me more about it? That is also a form of influence. Your ideas are traveling without you having to be the person saying them. So, yeah, there's lots of ways to.

Dive (02:08.204)
Hmm.

Catt Small (02:15.376)
think about influence, but it definitely boils down to your ideas traveling and people trusting the message that you are sharing.

Dive (02:24.513)
I love the idea of ideas traveling and even reflecting on my own journey doing this podcast, one of the clear things that I've kind of taken with me and brought into my practice is thinking about the meme ability of my ideas. Like how concisely can you portray an idea so that that next person can then deliver it on your behalf? And I never really thought about that intentionally. I still don't even know if I have concrete tactics for it yet, but

That as a measuring stick for influence makes a ton of sense.

Catt Small (02:55.116)
A thousand percent. Yeah, there's like a framework. Like the more that you create frameworks for people, found people really like frameworks. love illustrations, diagrams, things like that, that can help them to kind of like wrap their mind around what you're trying to convey to them. And that's actually also the benefit of storytelling. So storytelling is also a really important part of bridging the gap from senior to staff. And

Really, that's like one of the big differences in the work that I do is that I'm thinking a lot more about how I can tell a story that overlaps, you know, a customer pain with a business problem and then pitch that to people essentially to suggest that we go in a certain direction with a project or maybe I'm trying to propose an entirely new project. But I found that, yeah, like that is also part of influence when you're figuring, when you figure out.

how to share information in a way that is most compelling to other people.

Dive (03:52.822)
Maybe we could talk about just all of the gaps that you'd have to bridge or least the most important ones. So if someone's listening to this and they want to chart their own personal path to building influence, maybe over like a six month time horizon, how should they think about that journey and what are some of the key checkpoints along the way?

Catt Small (04:12.302)
That is such a good question. When you're thinking about becoming more influential, the first step is definitely surveying your relationships. So taking a look at the relationships you have at your job at that moment and essentially analyzing the different kinds of workplace relationships that you have. So do you have most connections with people who are your peers, for example? So those are maybe people who are directly contributing to your work, but they're not like,

stakeholders per se. And then I also think it's important to look at how strong the relationships you have are with your stakeholders. are you talking to the director of product design on a semi-regular basis? Do you have connections with your, like how close are you to your design manager? How close are you to the product leaders at your company, for example, as well? And once you have an understanding of your current state, then you can actually start.

strategizing how you're going to build stronger connections with maybe more of those people at the leadership level. Because one thing that's really

important to be able to do is to have allies and like advocates essentially who are able to again share ideas on your behalf and they are able to you know vouch for you or rally for you if you have people who disagree who are at their level and so one of the big reasons people fail to influence is that they don't have those allies who are at levels that can actually essentially throw their weight around when necessary.

So I think a big part of it is power and the relationships of power between people and getting better at understanding those. And so once you have an understanding of those, then you can, you know, again, invest energy into building those connections. Then once you have more of those connections that are in a better place, then that's when you actually should, you can start experimenting and you can start providing ideas about certain things. And then it becomes a question of what,

Catt Small (06:13.25)
Do you spend your energy on? And that I think is the other big part of the work. So when I was senior, one of the things I did a lot of was spreading my energy very thin. And I was working on the employee resource group, which I really loved doing. I was also building design team culture. I was helping with improving onboarding for the design team. was throwing my weight around with improving the way we wrote.

our specs, like our product specs. was like improving JIRA tickets, like a bunch of stuff that isn't actually the designer's job. Like it is valuable work, but it's not actually what a hands-on designer, you know, is measured for when it comes to the promotion. So I started auditing my workload and where I was spending my energy. And I started asking myself what is actually, you know, part of the title that I'm looking for, what's expected of a staff designer.

And then I realized, okay, I actually just need to really focus on delivering great work. if I, you know, unfortunately I have to cut some of these other things, but the benefit of that is that I can actually focus. can build my storytelling skills. I can build my communication skills. And that was a big part of me getting to that next step. So yeah, I think once you start to focus your energy on problems that you actually want to be known for solving.

then what happens is people start knowing you for those things. And when you have strong relationships, then that kind of converges and then you end up in a great place where you have influence.

Dive (07:46.802)
Okay, so there's kind of two pieces there. There's the relationship side and then there's the how do I use my time? So maybe we could start with just digging into the relationships piece a little bit. Let's say that I've done my audit of workplace relationships and realized, yeah, I'm pretty low on the totem pole basically. Like I don't have a lot of stakeholder friends. It's mostly peer connections. And again, thinking about this six month roadmap for myself, what can I do? It feels so wishy washy to like invest in relationships like.

How would you think about that as a designer if my goal is to bring on allies at more of the stakeholder level?

Catt Small (08:23.726)
Yeah, I would start by figuring out who is most

Who, which of the leaders that I think I need to connect with to be more influential, which of them are most connected to the project work that I'm doing immediately. So I would then plan to, I would schedule time with them either on a monthly basis or a quarterly basis. So for example, if you have a director of product design who, you know, is your manager's manager, then I would make sure to meet with that person once a month and I would make sure to meet with my manager. Probably, you know, once a week, something like that.

And then during those meetings, what's really important is to show up with questions. So don't just bring us a status update, although those are nice sometimes, but what's actually important is to make sure that in those conversations, you are asking what's top of mind for them, what's happening in their world as of late, things that they wish that the team were doing or would stop doing. Questions like that actually help you understand what their goals are. And then that opens up avenues of conversation for you to.

you know, make suggestions or share insights, share things that you're learning as well, or share, you know, where you're aligning in terms of what they've said that maybe resonates with you. So the more that you do that, then the more trust you are building and the more that they will understand that you're somebody who is an ally to them also. And usually I also ask, you know, is there anything that you need help with? Because one of the other things that I've learned over the years is that the more that you are useful to your manager, the more

they appreciate you and your work, and they will think of you on the short list of people who can help them with certain things that they need to get done. So the more you become a person who gets things done, the better. And essentially, by doing that for a couple of months, you will probably find that your relationships are stronger because you have been building this series of conversations.

Catt Small (10:23.64)
where you're identifying the overlaps. And ideally, you also take notes. You can use whatever note-taking app you want. If there are things that they do request that you help with, then you really want to make sure to take note of those and actually follow up on those later. So that's something else that I always tell people, like be ready to document, you know, the certain tasks that you agree to do and then make sure to update those people about them, make sure to follow up afterward. And that consistency is also going to build trust that you are somebody that

they are able to rely on. So really what you're trying to do is you're trying to consistently show that you're a reliable person who agrees with them on certain things and you probably have insight that they're not aware of because you are closer to the work, you're closer to your peers, you have a view that they just don't have. So when you become a valuable asset to them, then of course, you're gonna have like a stronger relationship in general. that's what I mean when I say invest in relationships is actually

you know, make sure that you're connecting with those people on a regular basis. And then if there's people who are like kind of further outside the ring, maybe they're not your immediate project stakeholders or something like that, but you think they're cool. I usually talk to those people once a quarter. So I'll schedule a quarterly conversation. And those people are also nice to have because

maybe your company reworks, for example, and one of them ends up being your manager or in your reporting chain. And then you have a strong relationship. So if there are people that you admire, you think that they're the way that they think is really interesting, it is worth also connecting with those people, especially if you notice that they tend to get their way. And some of this sounds like really, I mean, it is, is politicking to be frank with you. Yeah. Yeah. It's the way the world works. Also as a staff designer.

Dive (12:06.088)
It's true though, it's politics but it's like that's the way the world works.

Catt Small (12:14.038)
You are kind of a diplomat. Like you are essentially navigating relationships. You are much more hands-on. So you're going to be delivering a lot of in the pixels work, but a lot of the job is also understanding the structures of power. Who has it, who doesn't, how certain people feel about certain things, how emotions are affecting the way that people show up to work and understanding essentially how to highlight, you know, the goals that everybody has and where the overlaps are and where there is maybe some friction that needs to be resolved.

Dive (12:45.732)
idea of starting with a leader that's a closer node and having that recurring conversation being a next step, my follow-up question is going to be hilariously specific but I really just want to get into the details here which is okay I open up Slack, I click new DM, the cursor is blinking in this input, what the heck am I typing? Like let's say that it's not a culture where one-on-ones, recurring one-on-ones are common.

Right? Like how do I present that conversation in a way that feels valuable for the other person versus obviously me just trying to get plugged in, you know?

Catt Small (13:26.156)
Yeah, that's a great question. Usually when I am starting to invest in working relationships with people, I may send them a DM and I may say something like, hey, I realized that we don't have a regular time to connect. And I'm actually really curious about the way that you think about the work. And I think that having at least one ad hoc one-to-one conversation will be really helpful for making sure that we're on the same page about.

the work that we're trying to do and I think that me getting a better understanding of your goals will help me understand where we overlap. So is it okay if I set up 30 minutes? I will be honest with you. Usually I just grab the time and I put in the description that exact message basically. I'll say like, hey, we don't really normally have one-to-one time together. So I'm just grabbing this time so that I can learn more about you.

Dive (14:13.158)
You

Catt Small (14:20.128)
smiley face or something like that, you know, and usually that isn't enough. And if you want to be more specific, of course, people love an agenda so you can put, you know, agenda with bullet points that say, you know, introductions, five minutes, and then like, you know, what's going on in your world lately? Question mark, like you can literally like outline the questions you plan to ask so that they can prepare for the conversation. But yeah, people in my experience are quite open to just having these conversations with people and

Dive (14:21.668)
Yeah.

Catt Small (14:48.972)
I mean, people just don't ask. Like they don't know that they can ask. So I encourage you as people who are listening to actually reach out proactively because if you don't, I mean, you have to have a really present leader for them to do that for themselves, but they're just so busy. They just don't really have the time. So unfortunately, a lot of times it's on us to actually make sure that we're doing that outreach.

Dive (15:14.287)
You did frame it very specifically though, where it was like, I wanna hear your ideas, you know? And anytime you're making someone feel heard, it's like, yeah, of course, people like talking about their ideas, you know? So I did kind of underline the way that you positioned that request. Makes a lot of sense. I wanna transition to the other piece that you talked about, which is kind of your own personal ROI of like, how am I allocating my time as someone whose ultimate goal, at least for the purposes of this conversation, is career growth.

What should I be doing? And it seems like there is this almost returned focus to the core work. If there's anything more to share there by all means, I'm also kind of curious, like outside of the day-to-day responsibility, what have you found to be the highest ROI activities that you as a designer could be doing who is looking for this next step in the career?

Catt Small (16:09.056)
Yeah, so I think for me where the energy audit came from is learning about this term called glue work, is, it was coined by Tanya Riley, who is a super seasoned engineer. And Tanya recognized that this is, there's this, this endemic issue where essentially really well-meaning people will fill in gaps that

they need to be filled by somebody. And ideally there would probably be somebody hired into those positions or, you know, maybe there's just people are too busy and they're understaffed. And, you know, that person decides that they will be the one to be the hero and fill the gap in. And it is important that that work again gets done. Like it is important that somebody is thinking about team culture. It's important that somebody's improving onboarding. But the question is, should that be like, do you want to be known for that stuff?

Is that the thing that you want people coming to you for, or is it just that somebody had to do it? And then I usually ask myself, like, does it have to be me or actually should somebody else be doing that? So that was where the original issue came from for me was that I noticed, you know, after I learned this term, I noticed I was doing a lot of glue work and that was a big part of why I just didn't have the capacity to invest in some of the things that my manager and her manager

were saying that they needed to see from me to get to that next level, which is really creating visions, like exploring potential overlaps between my team and other teams. Like I was just spending all of that energy on this work that had not very much to do with my actual job title. So I personally feel like the energy audit is very important. And what you can do is, again, you ask yourself, what do you want to be known for?

Is it the work that you're, is it that particular problem that you're trying to solve right now? Is that problem actually somebody else's problem to solve? And then I also like to ask what the business impact of the issue is. So sometimes we get really wrapped up in things that are in like, are important. They're incredibly important. But, if the business does not value them, then you either have to accept that that's something that you're going to do.

Catt Small (18:29.26)
because you are a very kind person and that's fine. Or you need to reevaluate if you want to spend your energy on that at all. So in my case, I realized, okay, like I do care about team culture, of course, but maybe there's a way that I can invest in team culture while not expending so much energy. So instead, now what I do as a staff designer, for example, is I have regular one-to-ones with any designers that I'm working with on the team. And so I get to do a lot of direct mentorship.

and I do pair designing with them. And during that time, they can ask any questions that they want, you know? So they ask me, you know, hey, like, how did you get to the level that you're at? Like all those kinds of things that I wanted to be able to share with people in other formats, I've figured out a way to actually have it be part of my job description. So that's something I recommend thinking about. And yeah, when it comes to ROI, it really is that question of like what...

Dive (19:18.338)
Hmm.

Catt Small (19:27.786)
what is, you know, if you're looking at the next level, for example, like what does the job description actually include? And then the business, I mean, the business really likes it when you do things that are, you know, overlapping with their goals. So a lot of what I will spend my time on is thinking about new business opportunities or opportunities to, you know, like create more consistency or cohesion, ways that we can speed up our processes. I will think about

You know, how do I extend the work that I'm doing right now into the near future? Like what am I building toward? So those are pretty straightforward ways usually for a senior designer to show that they're ready to go to that next level is to think about, you know, like to think outside of the scale of just their team or to think outside of the scale of the immediate project that they're working on. So how do you push that just a little bit further and think a little bit more broadly? Cause that's what a staff designer does. We zoom out.

and then we zoom back in and then we zoom back out again.

Dive (20:28.663)
Okay, so let's talk about this visioning piece. I like that label that you give it and you break it down into defining and presenting. So maybe we could start off in that definition phase. What have you learned about that process?

Catt Small (20:44.224)
It is so critical to make sure that you are actually assessing the reason that you're doing the vision in the first place. And I think it's really important when you're in the definition phase to actually get buy-in and support from the appropriate teammates. So something I've seen a lot is that a design leader will say, Hey, we should do a vision. And then product is not involved. And that is.

Usually the number one way that a vision becomes useless immediately after it's done is that like there is no product support because we as design usually are not owning the roadmap. like if there's nobody who actually owns the roadmap involved with the process, they're going to feel of course, like their territories being encroached on, they're going to feel like they're being told what to do and they're going to feel like you're saying that their job is useless, right? So they're not going to listen to you.

And maybe you're right that some of the things that you came up with should be on the roadmap. So you need to make sure that you're involving them so that they have input and they feel like it's partially theirs. So that's number one, when it comes to defining, you know, what we're doing. Just involving the right people is really important. So I always tell people, make sure that upfront you are talking with your product manager or your product partner. You have a researcher. If you have researchers at your company, I hope you do. And then if you also have product marketing.

people, then I definitely recommend also involving them. Because what you're trying to do with a vision is you're trying to tell a story of how you end up in a short or long term future where you are serving a certain customer. so product marketing can help you figure out how you want to position the product. And the more that you have that conversation upfront as part of that visioning work, then you're essentially putting stakes in the ground for multiple parties and you're making everybody's job a lot easier. So

For example, when I was working at Asana, I collaborated with my user researcher, my product manager for the area that we had created. And then we had a product marketing person as well. And we were very, very close together from the beginning of the process. So we sat down together and figured out who we were targeting, like which customer segments we wanted to target.

Catt Small (23:02.502)
we were thinking about like, what is the business opportunity financially? Like, why do we think we should invest energy into this work? and then, yeah, we figured out like, what are the most common pains and the general broad themes of the work that we want to actually explore within this vision. And like, essentially that's going to create our roadmap longer term. So that's a lot of like the definition of the out, the outlining phase. and then there's also of course going to be, you know, digging into the ideas.

So then once we have like a broad outline of what we're trying to do, essentially then I have a picture of which teams I need to go talk to. And so at that point, then I met with different people, different designers, mostly on different teams to get ideas about how, you know, what we're thinking about might overlap with what they're thinking about. And so I was working on goal management. There were designers who were working on Asana has projects, right? So there's projects with tasks in them.

So how might goals overlap with projects? How might goals overlap with portfolios, which are like folders of projects? Like what are other areas within the product where seeing goals might actually be really valuable? So I essentially asked that question to lots of different designers and sat down with them in Figma and like sketched with them and stuff like that and got a bunch of initial ideas. And then I went back, I created like a summary outline and then went back to my PM.

and we sat down and we just kind of filtered through everything and looked for the strongest ideas. And then I started to actually illustrate them. So I always tell people, do not start actually doing high fidelity designs until you have a strong outline. Because if you are like making things too pretty, then you're like missing the conversation about the concept. And that's actually the most important thing. So once you have all of that, you know, you can actually...

keep iterating and refining and refining, and then hopefully you have a story there. So you ideally start with the customer suffering at the beginning because they don't have this thing. Then they learn about your feature somehow. Product marketing will help you with that part. And then once they learn about your product, then what is the experience like? How does their life change? So it's kind of like a hero's journey almost. And that's the importance of the storytelling aspect.

Dive (25:17.428)
Mm-hmm.

Dive (25:22.538)
I want to get into the storytelling piece. I'm to put a quick pin in that and I want to go back to something you talked about in terms of the fidelity levels because there's this narrative that I'm seeing a little bit more where people, leaders might be saying, you know what? We want you to jump straight to high fidelity and we want a fully clickable prototype and you should vibe code it this afternoon because we're going to talk about it tomorrow and just put it in front of me. Obviously that kind of work.

or that sequencing of work wasn't necessarily that possible, know, even six months ago, depending on where you're operating. So how do you think about that? Cause I know a lot of designers are trying to make sense of how much do these new capabilities actually influence the way that I practice design.

Catt Small (26:10.07)
Yeah, I mean, it's, I think there's upsides and there's downsides, right? Like the more that your work is high, like the higher fidelity that your work is, the more usually people will concentrate on the visual execution of the work versus the actual concept behind the work itself. And they, they may get really nitty gritty about the interactions, for example, within the prototype and they might.

feel like, this is like the only thing that we can go forward with. So I guess my feelings about this are, if you're gonna go the route of making these high fidelity prototypes, I would definitely suggest making several of them and showing several different options. And I think that optionality is really important because as designers, we know that ideas are cheap.

and execution is really important. So like if we're trying to talk about ideas, know, thinking about ways to focus people on the ideas, can you, you know, have like some parts of it look high fidelity, but can you have like, you know, wireframe text here and there, for example, like are there still ways to make it clear that what we actually need to do is to have a conversation about the concept.

I think also sometimes you can ask people questions about why they want to see things in a certain format. So, you know, maybe it's that they want to model good craft for the broader design team, or like maybe there's a reason they want to ultimately get to that high fidelity, vibe coded prototype. but like, if you have a conversation about the objectives, like, can you pull it, can you pull it back? You know, can you zoom out and have a discussion about what you're doing and like why.

they are asking for that particular request, like what are they hoping to see? Maybe you'll learn something that can help guide the conversation also and align a little bit more. So you can say, hey, you I want to understand what your objectives are there because yes, ultimately we should get to that prototype. But if we do that before we actually have discussed the ideas and just sketch them out or something like that, I think we're going to get really attached to.

Catt Small (28:18.56)
whatever I end up by coding. And, you know, there might be a lot of other options out there that we could explore. And I want to make sure that I'm investing my energy appropriately. So I find that usually when, when I at least, mention, know, that I want to make appropriate investments in my, with my energy, or if I think about like, that's an expensive use of my time or, know, like, how do we prevent waste? Like leaders tend to resonate a lot with that language around like making sure that you're

Dive (28:21.48)
Yeah.

Catt Small (28:48.288)
appropriately allocating time. So yeah, I think like as designers, we can, you know, show up with curiosity and it's, think it's about not being defensive. So a lot of times I'll see people push back in a way that is really defensive. And that is usually why.

they struggle to actually have those conversations. But yeah, like I think on one hand, you can try to be open and curious because maybe they have a reason that they are asking for a very particular series of interactions in a prototype, also why not? Yeah, like why not ask them for more detail versus just doing that work and trying it out? So yeah, sometimes I will ask that question and then I'll agree if, you know, they have like a particular

vision in mind for like the way they want to work. And then if it doesn't work out, then, we'll reflect on it. We'll go back and we'll try a different way.

Dive (29:41.34)
Yeah. I love the simple question of just, love the simple response of just asking why. I think a lot of people, at least from my experience, just being on Twitter, Reddit forums, seeing how people are responding to this situation. That's very, very real. So many designers are in this situation right now. And I think a lot of people just kind of begrudgingly accept the mandate and then kind of ask internally, why am I doing this? You know? And so understanding some of those deeper motives makes a lot of sense. I also think.

your point about sharing multiple options is so key too. Because if you are not just sending someone a prototype that looks and feels very real, but it's like, hey, here's what I'm kind of thinking, that changes the whole frame, right? Like a thing that I've naturally found myself doing while dog-footing in flight that I wasn't necessarily doing before is putting multiple prototypes on a canvas and then actually making a spectrum.

And like, here's the axes, here's this side of the axes, here's this side of the axes. And here's a few different ideas for each one. Play with each one and let me know where you think we should fall on this spectrum. And now all of a sudden it's like asking someone to not point out what they like or just like inside of the single interactive prototype. But it's like, I want people to kind of point on a spectrum. Like, where do you think roughly we should be in between these concepts and what should we pull from each of them? And it totally changes the way that.

you get feedback from a stakeholder in that situation.

Catt Small (31:10.712)
Heck yeah. Yeah, I think that's like the thing. Like I want to acknowledge that different companies have different cultures around design. So for the book, I also interviewed Randy Hunt, who is at Notion. And he mentioned that his team is very prototype forward and they just like kind of play around all day in, you know, like with these different ideas and they're pretty high in fidelity and

If your company has a culture where that is totally viable and you can communicate ideas through, you know, like these are a spectrum of prototypes, like these are different options, like it's, it's, it's really about making sure that you're putting people in the right head space to give the kind of feedback that you're looking for. And so I think it's important to be flexible. Um, when you're

you know, working on a vision. Like you need to make sure that you're acknowledging the context of the company that you're within. And there's only so much that you can really push the design culture. And you also have to recognize that like some design cultures, if you show up with like a low fidelity wireframe, they just react. Like design leaders in particular at some companies, maybe like more agency type folks will like...

look at that and be like, what the heck is this? You know? And so I want to acknowledge that there are some places where the energy will be different if you bring like something that's not as high fidelity and you will have to figure out ways to work around that. So if you are in a company where, you know, high fidelity is kind of the way that everybody operates, then yes, like you have to then make sure that you're doing a little bit more to show like, just because I'm showing this one idea does not mean that is the end all be all.

Dive (32:24.753)
Mm-hmm.

Catt Small (32:49.486)
You can show different options. You can have like a little note that says for placement only. Like you can have like, you know, wireframe text, but everything else looks almost done. And those are just examples of ways I've also, yeah, Micah, another thing that I remember Micah doing really well when we worked together at Asana was that Micah would make the fidelity look really nice, but would add this like blue overlay to the screen. So was very obvious.

Dive (33:14.396)
Hmm.

Catt Small (33:16.77)
that this is like a future that we could have, but like, you know, it's not done. So simple things like, yeah, like a color overlay can change people's mindsets. So even if you need to, you know, work in that fidelity, there's ways around it.

Dive (33:22.759)
That's cool.

Dive (33:32.999)
I love the blue overlay because it almost becomes a trademark at that point. Like the third time somebody sees it, they already understand like, this is just a potential feature. Like you don't even have to give the context maybe.

Catt Small (33:42.391)
Yeah, yeah, I definitely started taking that after I saw Micah present that way. was like, my God, you are so good. You're so great. Yeah, honestly, she was a huge inspiration for me in terms of learning how to do better at storytelling and visioning. And there's so many people that I admire that I got to interview for this book. And I was just so grateful for their time and their expertise.

Dive (34:07.387)
Any other highlights from those interviews when you were reflecting on what should go in the book and you're kind of just like, who's really impacted me on my journey or what are the little nuggets that I've taken from different people? Anything else that stands out that we should talk about?

Catt Small (34:20.136)
man, I really loved talking to managers of design of staff designers. And what was really fun was getting more perspective about why, you know, like why we might as staff designers end up in situations where our managers are kind of like breathing down our backs. So Jess Dale was one of the other people that I interviewed and Jess is a senior manager who's worked with a ton of staff designers and

Yeah, what I really appreciated about our conversation was that point of like, Jess basically is in all these meetings where they have to like share, you know, updates with other people about the work that my team is doing, for example, and like other teams that, you know, report to Jess. And I remember in my first role as a staff designer, I remember just being kind of like irritated about having to do like, you know, a weekly status update.

and just like not understanding why I couldn't just like focus on the work itself. and like why I had to like make sure to always list out everything that I was up to. And now I get that, you know, these people are really busy. They do a lot of context switching. They just aren't going to be able to like look in Slack and see like what you're, what you're working on. Like they actually do need the summary and it's actually like really important to make sure that you're managing up as part of your process.

because the more that you're proactively communicating what you're doing, that also builds trust and they don't have to, you know, breathe down your back and like ask you or like ping you for like updates about things. So now I work really hard to make sure that I am proactively communicating where everything's at so that my manager doesn't have to like track me down and like figure out what I'm up to anymore. And that's actually also something that's like really important for your own promo packet, for example, like

those bullet points that you're keeping track of every week, if you are also tracking the impact at the end of your project, then you can literally just list that out. And then when it comes promo time, you just have everything you need to actually hopefully propose yourself for that promo.

Dive (36:23.151)
Yeah.

Dive (36:30.191)
Yeah, that's so great. I mean, we talk about that through the lens of creating or setting your future portfolio up for success, but it's the exact same thing for, if you want to make a case for a promotion, you got to have the historical log. And if you're tackling that from scratch, it's going to be quite painful.

Catt Small (36:47.278)
thousand percent.

Dive (36:48.828)
Okay, so we talked about the definition kind of side of things. You touched on a little bit of the presenting, but I want to make sure that we're covering everything there because I know it's kind of a lot and the storytelling piece is a big part of what it looks like to build this influence as a staff designer. So let's assume that people listening to this are kind of familiar with the basics, know, setting context, leading with

user problems, connecting to business outcomes, like those kind of core boxes. Let's just build on top of that. So what else are some of the best staff designers doing when presenting their ideas?

Catt Small (37:28.012)
Yes, I definitely think that they are figuring out the format that will resonate most with their audience. So when it comes to actually presenting information, they're thinking about, you know, am I going to have to present this to the head of product? Does the head of product prefer a write up or do they prefer a presentation? Do they prefer a clickable prototype?

And they're also thinking about how this information is going to on beyond them, essentially. So like, where is it going to exist and how do I make sure it's accessible to lots of people? Because I've really, I also got to interview Kyle Terman. And one thing that Kyle said that I really appreciated was, Kyle said like,

I used to just think that when I was done with the vision, the work was done, but actually distribution is the most important part of the process. Like you don't share the work. Nobody knows it happened. So you have to be sure that you're communicating it. So can you get a spot in design all hands? Can you get a spot in your company's all hands meeting? Can you go around and meet with the different teams that you may be previously ideated with and come back and show them the result of the work that you did?

Dive (38:16.533)
Hehehehe

Catt Small (38:38.254)
There's lots of conversations that need to be had so that you are actually making sure that people are aware that the vision exists. And if you do a good job with that, then you end up in a situation where your work is being referenced over and over again. So I mentioned that when I was at Asana, I worked on a vision. That vision was actually for, we had actually done an MVP, we had built an MVP. And then I made the vision because...

We had a lot of customer feedback that we were getting, but we couldn't really figure out how to prioritize that. then leadership was also kind of like, of course, providing their opinion, which they have a right to do, but we didn't really feel like we had our own opinion as a team. So we were just kind of like swaying with the wind. And I observed that and I mentioned to my PM that it might be a good idea for us to create a vision, because we could then have.

more opinions about what we were doing and we could own our own destiny, essentially. And so she really liked the idea of spending some time on that. And basically by the time we got to the end of that process, we had a bunch of ideas that we could decide how to prioritize on the roadmap. And some of those did get more immediately prioritized. So I think now, like one of the things we worked on immediately after that was being able to automatically calculate the progress of goals so that you can kind of have them ladder up.

And you don't have to like invest so much energy in manually looking through and seeing, well, my five sub goals are 25 % done. So that means like, whatever, you know, like that's a lot of busy work. And so that was like the immediate work that got prioritized. But then there were other things that were in that vision. And that vision was two to five years, I believe was the range that we were looking at. And I left that company, I think in 2022.

And then in 2023, so like a full year after I left, there was a feature that got launched that was in that vision. So I think it was gold templates or something like that. And I was like, my God, like, that's so cool. Like I predicted the future and they're still. So that's cool. and when you do a vision, when you make a vision and like, after you make a vision, you know that it is impactful because of things like that. Like people continue to reference it.

Dive (40:30.422)
Nice.

Dive (40:35.968)
Yeah, you did something right.

Catt Small (40:50.22)
You predict the future appropriately. You see features that you thought of way back when out in the world several years later. That is how you know that a vision was successful. So that was a huge part of it. And yeah, we went around and presented the information in lots of different forums. We, I remember I definitely put it in different locations that would make it easy for people to find. So I attached it to a bunch of different documents that seemed relevant.

Dive (41:20.344)
Hmm.

Catt Small (41:20.346)
And yeah, I made sure that it was just accessible to people who may not know who I am. I did also record a video presentation. like that was also part of it was making sure that in addition to the presentation itself, I actually had a video walkthrough of it explaining all the content that was in the presentation. So yeah, that was like a big effort.

Dive (41:42.304)
And that's just a doc. Like that's just a doc. Then you're linking to that doc in different places, right? Genius.

Catt Small (41:47.787)
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So it was like a slide. It was like a slideshow because we had a very unique type of customer within the Asana sphere. And so that's the thing you have to think about as part of your formatting is, you know, can you get away with the prototype? Like, do you have one customer and everyone at the company knows who that customer is? Or do you need to actually do a slideshow because you need to kind of prime people to understand like, who is this customer? We don't actually know who they are. So the format will also

Dive (42:11.544)
Mm-hmm.

Catt Small (42:17.676)
you know, be determined by like the context of the content that you need to deliver. So yeah, we just had a slideshow and like we would link to that from different places.

Dive (42:27.51)
never combine those in that way and I'm so pro video in everything but that's really genius. Like in my brain it was very distinct. You're presenting something live or you're like writing a doc or embedding a deck but having some kind of an artifact that you can link to anywhere which is kind of everything including you actually talking through a presentation that's a really smart tactic.

Catt Small (42:51.374)
Thank you. Yeah, I love asynchronous video. It is one of my favorite additions to the work sphere and I use it so often. Yeah, I use it for vision purposes so that I can add color to all of the work that I've already done. I also use it when I want to get feedback from members of my team. like explaining like, maybe I've coded a prototype and I want to show what I learned about it or like I want to get feedback on something that I've been working on lately, like

Dive (42:59.234)
same.

Catt Small (43:19.744)
asynchronous video is such a huge, it's such a powerful tool.

Dive (43:26.849)
committed the next few years of my life to working on it. So I definitely agree. Let's, I wanna go back to something else you talked about, which is the momentum piece of the puzzle, because I don't know about you, I've been in this situation many times where I have a vision, right? I've broken it down into milestones because I wanna make it feel like there are concrete stepping stones and it doesn't have to be this big upfront investment. And everyone's like, yeah, let's do it. And then we ship the first one, maybe,

two milestones and you're feeling pretty good, but they were very much so just setting up the real North Star and then over time you kind of lose momentum and you only get about 40 % of the way through your vision and you actually end up shipping something that you wouldn't have never even designed in isolation. It was just a setup to get to the real act that you wanted to bring to life. Does that resonate and do you have any advice for other designers in that situation?

Catt Small (44:24.896)
Yeah, finishing the swing is usually what I refer to the ideal situation, which we do not always end up doing. I think, yeah, it is, it is a common issue that teams do not finish the swing. You get through step one or step two of the like longer term, you know, roadmap or the vision. And then some other priority comes up. I think that is.

part of why I think you need to make sure that you're involving product and that ultimately you tie as much of the work that you're doing to the business goals because the more that you can connect that work to the expected outcome, it will be more likely that you do get investment longer term. There are definitely gonna be times where the company level strategy changes. I've worked at companies where

They're kind of like zigzagging, you know, and like one year it's this, one year it's that. So you will not always be able to control that. I think that in those kinds of situations where maybe, for example, something seemed like it was relevant and now it's not, I will have a discussion with the team about how we want to approach it. And I will try to name the pattern that like, Hey, we, didn't finish the swing here. Like, what is that? Why is that? And.

you know, do we still feel like it's worth investing in the longer term? So I think one thing that designers can do is they can bring up the vision that the team created at points where it's relevant. So maybe you are starting to think about roadmap planning and you can have a conversation there. And if people are kind of like, no, no, like we don't want to go to iteration three. I think then you can ask that question of like, well, why, why not? Was there something missing? Do we need to iterate on where we were trying to go?

And that can open up a really healthy conversation about how to move forward. But I also think that when I'm making a vision, one thing that I try to do is I try to think about ways to make it so that I maybe can, I don't know, I think there's a couple of approaches. You can do like the Lego approach where it's like, all right, all these features that I'm talking about are like.

Catt Small (46:39.042)
You know, they're bite-sized chunks of value that we're providing to customers that build up to like, you know, like a Megazord awesome product, but maybe it's less about like phase one, phase two. And it's more like customers should be able to perform this action. Customers should be able to perform this particular action. So it's less about like, the presentation will look like this at this particular stage. And then like that. I think usually when I'm making a vision, I'm more concentrating on like what value is the customer receiving?

and in what ways, and then we as a group should plan, we should like figure out, you know, at what phase are we delivering this particular chunk of value. So it's less about the presentation over time, if that makes sense. And it's more about like the ideal services that we are gonna deliver to people in the two to five year range. So like, I actually didn't like illustrate much of a like, okay, how do we get to that two years from now?

I was mostly just like, okay, so in the future, like you should be able to automatically calculate progress on a goal and you should be able to have templates and you should be able to have this and that and this. And these are all different types of value that we're providing to people. And then when it came to project number one, which was the calculation, then I could be like, okay, so like, if we just look at this slice of value, like how do we deliver that more immediately?

So I think I built out the vision in a way where I didn't have to worry as much about phasing, if that makes sense. So I wasn't as bad when some things did not get prioritized.

Dive (48:09.108)
Mm-hmm.

Dive (48:13.119)
When you're kind of outlining what this potential future would look like and something as concrete as automatically calculating the status of a goal, how much UI are you having even figured out at that stage? And I guess part of me is thinking about that in terms of visual fidelity, but also just the fidelity of the concept in your own brain. Is it enough to say, hey, there's a target area here, there's something here, and when the time is right, we'll figure it out, and it's a part of this broader plan?

or is the expectation that you actually would have some pretty clear understanding of how that specific piece would work.

Catt Small (48:46.988)
Yeah, I think the closer you are to the timeframe that you're looking to envision, the higher fidelity you can be. So if you're looking at like six months from now and it's like a small, a, you're looking at like one service that you're hoping to deliver to a customer. Like if it was, if we were just doing a vision for the future of like automatic goal progress calculation, then I think I would have been much higher in fidelity than what I did for.

Like, what are we doing with this product overall? Like this whole area in two to five years, like, what's that going to be like that? I just have no idea where, you know, we're going to be able to go in like five years. and so every illustration that I did was like mid-fi at most, like it still looked pretty solid and it generally communicated the idea, but it was essentially a series of concepts that were like,

Dive (49:20.063)
Sure. Yeah.

Catt Small (49:37.367)
You know, we definitely need to dig into each of these, but we essentially were proposing to leadership that they give us the support and the time to dig into these because we think these, these features are going to resonate most with people or these concepts will resonate. So yeah, I think in my case, like I, I gave myself enough direction in terms of the visuals to say, well, this is what the outcome will be for our customers, but we don't actually know enough information to have it look super duper detailed. And we.

we need the time to do that. And so yeah, that was the ask from leadership. But yeah, if you're looking at like one year out or you're looking at six months away, then the fidelity is probably gonna be a lot higher and you'll probably have more confidence in what your outcome will be.

Dive (50:22.398)
When you're thinking about the ideal format for a vision, I'm sure there are some key variables that you're considering. We've now discussed the timeline as a big one that makes a heck of a lot of sense to me. What are some of the other things that you would be considering that might make it so that this vision over here looks one way, but this vision over here looks quite different? And if there are any examples that we could point to, that'd be awesome.

Catt Small (50:46.868)
Yeah, I think there's a couple, there's definitely like the scale, the scope of the product area that you're thinking about. So when I was working with this startup that was called Merit and they're called Scout now, one of the

things that one of the services they were trying to provide to customers was this idea of like being able to interview once you may have seen some of these kinds of products where it's like you interview one time and like your answers get shared with a bunch of hiring managers and then you know the hiring managers like I like that person and I want to talk to that person and so essentially when I was working with them you know they just came to me with the request to like create this like

Dive (51:16.788)
Mm-hmm.

Catt Small (51:29.624)
hiring manager experience and then like to create this like common application experience. And so what I did is I looked at both of those and I was like, all right, so you did tell me to just, you know, deliver the design, but this is where it could go in the future. And like, I think, you know, if like the ideal version of this would be this particular experience. And in that case, I will say that I was like being pretty scratchy about the UI, mostly because I was trying to

communicate to them what I think they were asking me for. And I didn't have a lot of confidence yet, so I didn't want to invest a lot of energy into making it look super fancy when I didn't really understand yet what the idea was. I think with that project, for example, I definitely was very prescriptive about the flow itself and the steps in the flow.

But because I didn't really know if what I was thinking was what they were thinking, I just didn't have the confidence to invest a lot of visual design energy. So I think those are some examples of things that I tend to think about. I'm thinking about the time scale. I'm thinking about the complexity of the flow. So am I thinking about an entire product area or an entire product and how this product will fit together? Or am I just thinking about a service that I'm delivering, like a very specific series of actions that a customer is performing?

will of course determine the amount of content that's in the presentation. And then yeah, am I confident that I understand what we're trying to do here? Or do I have a lot of open questions? And if I have a lot of questions, then it's gonna be lower fidelity. So I think those are like a couple of them. Yeah, I think sometimes there's also questions of, I understand if I'm thinking about the right customer base even? So sometimes that can also determine

you know, what content I will include or like again, how high fidelity I'll be working with. Um, so I remember when I was working, um, with this team, uh, I used to work at a consultancy called all turtles and one of their clients was this product that was called Marooni. And essentially they were taking these two other preexisting products and combining them into one new product that was called Marooni. And they didn't really, they, I mean, they kind of knew.

Catt Small (53:44.707)
they knew who the customer bases were of the previous products, but they didn't really fully, they had to figure out like what are the overlaps between these like different user bases. And so in that case, we were trying to figure out like a couple of things, which is like, what is the messaging? Like who are our target audiences? Who are the different users gonna be? And then like, what does it look like for them to interact with each other? So I think also in that case, you know, it was much more like, honestly, it was a lot lower fidelity at first because

We just had so many open questions about like, who are we designing for? So I think also, you know, the fidelity of the information that you have about like your audience and like the less you have validated, I also will decrease the fidelity because I just don't, like we need to learn first. And I always tell people that like the reason it looks the way that it does is because we have a lot of questions we need to answer. And the more that we answer these questions, the nicer I'm going to make this look.

Um, but yeah, we were just trying to figure out what to do like immediately. And so I wasn't going to spend a lot of time like making this super pretty thing. Whereas if I was like working on a vision for a product that was extremely established, then I would of course like invest a lot of energy in making it super presentable because it's probably going to end up in front of like 600, 800 people.

Dive (55:06.095)
Before I let you go, I have a little bit of a challenging question. And I want to reflect a little bit on your journey as someone who has thought a lot about how to teach these concepts, both through your course and writing this book. And from my own experience, man, it's a whole other ball game to figure out how to explain something in a way that makes sense. And I end up learning more about my own craft through the act of figuring out how to teach than doing the work itself. And...

my hunch is that you probably have had at least a somewhat similar experience. So through this process of figuring out how do I break down these ideas and figure out what matters most, what's the main way that your thinking has evolved in terms of what makes for a great staff designer?

Catt Small (55:55.725)
Gosh, yeah, I had no idea how much of the job was managing emotions and teaching until I had to sit down and think about teaching other people what I did not know before I got the job, if that makes sense. So yeah, of course there's craft stuff, right? Like there's, I spent a lot of time in...

Dive (56:14.117)
Hmm, yeah.

Catt Small (56:21.794)
design tools, like I'm in Figma, I'm in cursor, sometimes like playing around with ideas. But also I'm like doing, mean, you know, as designers, we've always negotiated with product and engineering, but like I have to deeply understand the motivations of everyone around me. And then I have to essentially figure out how to write myself when we get into a corner where we're kind of like, well, what the heck do we do now? And really like,

figuring out how to equip myself with all the information necessary to look at the context and to figure out the next step. It's really like you're in a cave and you're just slowly making your way through and your flashlight keeps flickering on and off and you're just trying to keep it going. That is how it feels most of the time. And yeah, I think I had to get really comfortable with ambiguity and helping other people to make that shift from

being told what to do to, you know, being comfortable with the fact that you may not fully know what the actual answer is yet, but you will figure out, you have an idea about how you might get there. I think that was a big part of the change for me personally. And then I've been really working to teach people how to, how to do that. So a lot of the time that I'm in my class, we do a lot of workshopping of problems and yeah, a lot of the problems come down to

people kind of like not fully understanding the people around them and like, we'll kind of like, I'll ask questions and like, we'll talk through, you know, how are you communicating with your peers right now or like with people above you, how often are you meeting with them? Like we do a lot of like workshopping of things that like, they almost feel like it's work therapy. It's almost work therapy. But yeah, it's like a process to change the way that you think about the work, right? So yeah, I love having those conversations and I...

It's been really cool to reflect on my own career because I see how much I've personally grown over the past several years as I've been practicing as a staff designer versus where I was at before. Like I am so much more focused on how I fit within the broader story of the company itself versus like me just spending a lot of time thinking about like, my PM is not delivering fast enough or like, like I'm not getting that promotion or things like that. Like I was very much like.

Catt Small (58:48.332)
me, me, me, me, me, like other people are not as good at the job as me. And now I'm like, okay, like what is happening in this person's life? Like what's happening over there? Like what are the pressures that everyone is experiencing? Like now I know much more about like mapping these kinds of things out. And that's through a lot of conversation, obviously with other people that I've been able to like learn and absorb a lot of that. But yeah, it is, is so much about like, there's so much context.

And it's been fun to like learn to ride the wave a little bit more.

Dive (59:19.339)
Hmm. Well, I'm sure a lot of people listening probably resonate with this idea of feeling like they're in a cave. I know that I do all the time just wandering around with a flashlight that has good days and bad days. So I know one thing you've been a heck of a flashlight today and really appreciate you coming on and talking and sharing a little bit of the journey and all of the wisdom that you've accumulated. And a personal note for me is even really understanding the importance of understanding what motivates people. You know, it's like it's a people game. It's a people game. And

It's something that, I don't know, it's almost like a little bit taboo to talk about at times, but it's kind of everything, you know? So I appreciate your willingness to get really tactical about exactly how do we phrase this and how do you reach out to this person? And I'm sure it's gonna make a big impact for people. So thanks, Kat.

Catt Small (01:00:06.03)
course, mean, politicking, feels really crabby at first, and I used to be very anti-politicking, and now that I understand much more about how it works, I actually think it's super interesting, and I hope that folks listening start to feel that way as well. Yeah, good luck to everyone.

Dive (01:00:22.286)
Thanks, guys.
