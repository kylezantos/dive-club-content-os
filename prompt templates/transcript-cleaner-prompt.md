# Instructions for transcript cleaning process:
1. Remove pre/post conversation setup
2. Standardize speaker labels (Host should always say "Ridd" and guest label should show guest's first and last name)
3. Clean up false starts and filler
4. Preserve complete thoughts and quotes
5. Mark clear topic transitions with "---"
6. Remove technical interruptions
7. Keep timestamps next to speaker label
8. Add a header with guest name, professional role, company, and topics discussed
9. Add "-cleaned" to the file name of the cleaned transcripts
10. Add descriptive topic headers after each "---" section break to help AI navigate the content (format: "### [Brief descriptive sentence about the topic discussed in this section]")
