### Description Hook

Design is built on the fundamentals of craft and early in your career this is the primary skill you’re building.

But eventually you realize that if you want to make real impact then you have to get others to buy into your vision for the future.

Our job as designers is to spot opportunities that other people miss, but that only matters if you can help others see what you see.

That’s why storytelling is the #1 growth area for senior designers.

So I interviewed [**Chris Abad**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisabad/?utm_source=dive-club.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=storytelling-for-senior-designers&_bhlid=1e650b79860c157c09bfb213c8d4060cba98aa02) to learn everything you can do as a designer to effectively share your vision and persuade stakeholders

He shares each step of the process he’s refined over 20+ years of leading teams at Google, Square, Dropbox, etc.

### Key Takeaways

**The biggest mistake designers make**
Let’s say you have an upcoming slot in next week’s product meeting and you have some ideas for a feature area you’re working on.

The mistake most designers make is starting to craft their presentation by pulling from various visual artifacts created over the last few weeks of exploration. We default to using these visuals as “cue cards”.

> “ you get a lot of content, but it's not cohesive and for someone who hasn't been living and breathing this project for the last X months, it gets really hard to follow”
> 
- Chris Abad

That’s why Chris follows a different approach 👇

---

**Emphasizing a single idea**
Product leaders will only remember 1-2 points out of your 20 minute presentation.

So the key is to build your story around a “peak moment” that emphasizes the exact idea you want people to cling to.

> “Otherwise, what happens is you throw 20 different ideas at me and then I decide which one I want to hang on to. And that might not be the most important one to you”
> 
- Chris Abad

In last week’s mini episode on systems thinking I talked about how I got buy-in for a new syllabus editor at Maven after 2+ years of trying.

The breakthrough was showing how the underlying tech could 1) improve the student experience 2) unlock new opportunities for instructors to preview lessons on their landing page

In that case my “peak moment” (i.e. the one idea I want to stick with people) is that we can accomplish two initiatives with a single building block .

Now the question is… where does that live in your presentation?

---

**Framing your “Peak Moment”**
Most designers tell stories that mirror the design process:

- Here’s the context
- Here’s the problem
- Here’s how we’ll solve the problem
- Q&A

But if you learned anything from Gabe Valdivia’s ideas about showcasing your work like a content creator … you already know that the best stories are rarely told linearly.

In the list above, the peak moment most likely exists somewhere in the “here’s how we’ll solve the problem” section. So what Chris often does is front-load that meaning his outline might look something like this:

- This is what the world could look like if all this works really well
- These are the obstacles getting in our way
- This is the proof I have that this is possible

The trap designers fall into is building up to the peak moment with a big crescendo … but if the executive started catching up on Slack notifications halfway through then you’ve already lost 😬

---

**How Chris writes his story**
Once Chris has his outline he does something pretty unique…

He records himself talking through it in a Loom video and then exports a transcript .

From there he refines his ideas in writing to land on a final script and storyboard.

One benefit of this is that it’s easier to get feedback on your presentation in this format too. People are naturally drawn to visuals so if you send someone a deck most of the critique will happen at that level. Not only that, but making changes to the core story is way easier when it’s nothing but text.

Once he’s figured out his story word for word, he uses ChatGPT to convert it back into bullet points so that it’s more natural to talk through and he’s not tempted to “read” his script out loud.

Only then is it time to figure out the slides 👇

---

**Structuring your slide deck**
The purpose of your slide deck is to reinforce what you’re saying and nothing more.

> “What you are saying is much more important than what’s on the screen”
> 
- Chris Abad

So whenever possible Chris avoids text on his slides because people will naturally read it first and only after they’re done will they check back in to what you’re saying).

But Chris does something else I found interesting too…

He often includes a portion of context as an “appendix” rather than the core flow of the deck. This can be useful during Q&A but it also allows him to make on-the-fly decisions about whether to go deeper into a specific topic based on what he feels the audience wants.

That might even mean he asks for permission first:

> “If we have time I can go deeper here… would you like me to go into it?”
> 
- Chris Abad

Good presentations are *flexible* presentations.

### Ridd’s Brain dump

I like the title for this a lot, specifically the word tactics because it makes the entire episode feel practical and I always want people to feel like there's something very specific that they can take away from a conversation. I also like the word senior a lot because I also want the episodes to feel aspirational and make people feel smart for listening to them. And I think you can do that by assuming some level of existing knowledge or intelligence or seniority from your audience. I think the alternative title, how to master design storytelling is pretty good too. I don't want to overuse it, but in general, anytime that the title starts with how to, I think that's a pretty good format to use at least every once in a while. I think this description hook is a little bit too long. It's kind of a different format than normal, but I do think the content is solid and I really like the line, that's why storytelling is the number one growth area for senior designers. I feel like I probably could have gotten there in two sentences instead of three sentences, but the high level format feels pretty strong. The description is good too. They're very specific bullet points. Nothing is generic, nothing is fluffy. It's describing concretely some of the things that you could expect to get out of listening. I like the phrase, "His new secret weapon software tool for storytelling," because that creates a large curiosity gap. You have to be careful though, because that type of language for a title, for instance, would probably start to feel a little bit too click-baity, but it works well for the description. That same idea applies to the newsletter as well. The subtitle, the biggest mistake designers make, is "Way to Click-baity for a subject line or for a title of an episode." That crosses the line into cringe territory for me. As a subtitle, I think you can get away with a little bit more click-baity language.  As far as the key takeaway goes, I think this one is really strong for a few reasons. One, the title, "Framing Your Peak Moment," is unique. You don't know what this is going to be about, but it feels very specific. And then I like how it creates this effect where you start off by describing the current shortcoming that people are probably familiar with, and then you describe an alternative way of looking at the problem of storytelling and get very specific about a solution. Anytime that we can challenge the typical way of thinking about something, that's going to lead to better content.
