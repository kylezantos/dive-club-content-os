### 🎙️ Proactive Portfolio Advice: Capture Testimonials Early

There are a few really practical pieces of advice around hiring and job transition stuff.

The first is: collect positive customer feedback and testimonials and organize it in a swipe folder *before* you need it.

So often, whenever we talk to customers, we're only ever asking them about the upcoming project—the thing that we're researching, the thing that we're doing next.

But ask them, *“What did you think about the last feature that we shipped?”*

Because if they give some kind of a positive quote, that's something that can go in a case study on your website.

And I never ever see quotations on people's websites.

But in the same way that you're writing compelling marketing copy for a product—that’s the frame of reference that we should be using when we're writing personal case studies for our own website.

If you can have someone else talking about the value that you created rather than yourself, it's always going to be more compelling.

So get those quotes and organize them before you need them—not after you've left that job.

### 🎙️ Visual Polish Still Matters—Even in Enterprise Work

There’s also an interesting note around what to do if you design a really ugly enterprise app.

Because hiring managers today are using visual design as the first way to weed out candidates.

And Dan was basically like: *just redesign it.*

Just redesign it with no constraints.

And nobody’s gonna know.

And if they *do* know, he’s gonna think that’s really cool and a positive thing—because you wanted to demonstrate your abilities and took the action to do so.

It’s not gonna be a knock.

And yet, I’ve never seen a designer redesign an enterprise app before.

So basically, Dan would say that an ugly design system is *not* an excuse for a lack of high-quality visual design on a portfolio.

### 🎙️ Design System Quality Defines AI Output

He has a really interesting idea around the resurgence of design systems.

I think they very quickly became synonymous with enterprise and were something that was just easy to write off as not worth it.

But now that we’re doing more AI prototyping and designers are owning more and more of the front end—the design system is everything.

And he had a line that I’m paraphrasing and I wanna get the quote exactly, but he talked about how the AI’s output basically **falls back to the worst scenario that your design system has**, or something like that.

That’s a pretty good quote.

### 🎙️ The Rise of Design Systems Consultants (For Startups)

He went so far as to say that a new type of fractional design role that could be really popular is **design systems engineering consultant**—to help teams get spun up with Cursor and have a really good system with all of their variables, a nice set of rules for Cursor, and maybe even education for the designers to learn how to use the system.

You could spin up so many teams and help them kind of enter this future way of working—and position yourself as an on-ramp for that.

But the only design systems consultants that I see target really, really big companies with a bunch of legacy designs.

### 🎙️ Onion Layer Thinking: Tie User Problems to Business Problems

Another idea that I thought was interesting was treating problems as an onion.

As designers, we all know that we have to speak to the problem in order to tell a compelling story about work that we want to do.

But too often, designers stop at the user problem.

And even if they come to the table with quotes and data, it's still missing a really big part of the picture.

You have to show the next level of the problem and articulate how this user problem ends up being a business problem.

What are the top-level metrics that are being impacted by a specific user problem or missed opportunity in the product?

So you can’t just stop at that first level.
