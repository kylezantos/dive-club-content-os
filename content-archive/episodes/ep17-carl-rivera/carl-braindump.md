### 🎙️ Design Is Severely Undervalued—But It’s the Key Differentiator

Carl believes that **design and designers are severely undervalued** in the market right now.

And actually, designers are the **second most valuable type of talent** in the entire market—outside of the foundational model researchers.

Because for the vast majority of the market, everybody is essentially outsourcing the job of model research to a handful of companies out in San Francisco.

So it’s basically commoditized. We can’t differentiate there.

So how *do* we differentiate?

### 🎙️ When Everyone Is a 7/10 Designer...

We’re racing toward a world where **everyone is a 7 out of 10 designer**—because AI gives you a baseline set of capabilities.

In the same way that Carl says *he’s a 7 out of 10 lawyer*, people will be able to vibe code apps that are “good enough.”

So the question that SaaS companies will be asking themselves is:

> What do we make so that people want to keep coming back to our product and paying for it, versus vibe coding it themselves when software is free?
> 

That’s where **design comes in**.

And it’s why Carl is obsessed with **pushing the craft**.

### 🎙️ Hot Paths Over Pixel Coverage

Carl is putting a **ton of emphasis on hot paths**.

He gets really opinionated about which parts of the product matter to invest in—and which parts are okay to leave at a 7 out of 10.

Instead of spreading the peanut butter evenly across the piece of bread, he wants to **concentrate design efforts on a smaller number of screens**.

---

### 🎙️ Design Systems for Scale—But Break the Rules When It Matters

To make this possible, he’s investing heavily in the **design system**.

By having an incredible design system, **non-designers** can own the design of **non-hot-path screens**.

The quality of outputs with AI is only as good as the quality of the inputs—so he wants to make those inputs **world-class**.

But then for the hot paths, he’s **hiring designers who are confident and skilled enough to draw outside of the lines.**

He doesn’t want it to feel like assembling Legos—even if they’re the most beautiful Legos in the world.

He wants people to get out the pencil, get out the scalpel, and **break the rules** to create something that stands out and is memorable.

### 🎙️ Lead with the Ideal State, Then Work Backward

Part of that is creating designs that don’t try to one-shot scope or focus too much on constraints.

Carl wants designers to show up and **imagine what the future could be**—to paint a picture of the ideal state.

And *only after that* conversation is had do you start talking about what to work backwards from, to create something that you can ship in the next few weeks.

### 🎙️ Avoid the Medium Term—Think Long and Short

Carl thinks that as an industry, designers and product teams spend too much time **mocking up the medium term**.

He really only wants designers to focus on:

- the **ultra long term** (vision)
- and the **short term** (shippable work)

Ignore the medium term altogether—because it’s the hardest to predict.

If you’re thinking about **long-run scenarios**, you can ignore the low-level details and just articulate a North Star.

But when you’re stuck in the medium term, it’s a weird mix of macro vision and execution-level detail—and that’s what makes it so hard to work with.

### 🎙️ Centralized Design Teams That Own Journeys

Another big point is how Carl is trying to **centralize the design team** at Shopify.

Not having people siloed into specific surface areas.

This relates back to the design systems philosophy—**not evenly spreading talent**, but instead concentrating it on **specific opportunities or full user journeys**.

He wants design to **own entire user journeys**, not static interfaces.

### 🎙️ The Molly Acquisition and Raising Talent Density

That’s part of why Carl **acquired the design studio Molly**.

It’s increasing the **talent density**, but it’s also **ushering in a new working model**.

He really wants design to **lead the way inside Shopify**.

They’re not staying comfortable.

They’re relying on design to **completely reimagine commerce from first principles for an AI era**.

What are truly native AI experiences?

How do those interfaces change?

These are the kinds of **big, meaty questions** Carl and the design team are tasked with figuring out.

---

### 🎙️ No Abstraction: Work > Storytelling

Another idea: Carl doesn’t let designers share **any context** for presentations.

He wants to **remove all abstraction layers** at every step of the process.

- No pre-reads.
- No decks.
- You’re either looking at a **Figma file** or a **prototype**.
- Even if you’re looking at data, it can’t be in a slide—you have to go into **Looker** or the original data source.

Why?

> Because users don’t get the benefit of a pre-read—and the team shouldn’t either.
> 

It puts more emphasis on the **work itself**, and **less emphasis on storytelling**, which is really interesting.

### 🎙️ Building Confidence Without Needing Business Justification

This ties back to Carl’s belief that we should build up **design’s internal confidence**.

Designers shouldn’t feel like they *have* to justify every decision with a clean business impact statement.

It’s okay for the **craft of a product to be incredible**—even if you can’t draw a direct line between that investment and specific metrics.

He believes that **over the long haul**, this is how you differentiate your product in the market.

And that circles all the way back to his original point:

Design is undervalued—but it’s the thing that can actually set a product apart when everything else is commoditized.
