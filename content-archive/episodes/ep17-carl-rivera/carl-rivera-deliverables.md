### Description Hook

What do you do when everyone becomes a 7 out of 10 designer overnight? That's the question Carl Rivera, Shopify's CDO, is wrestling with as AI democratizes design skills. While most companies panic about designers becoming obsolete, Carl sees this as the moment design becomes more valuable than ever. His counterintuitive approach: instead of trying to compete with AI-generated "good enough" work, he's doubling down on craft excellence and concentrating design talent on what he calls "hot paths"—the experiences that actually matter. I've studied his strategy for the past six months, and the frameworks he's implementing will fundamentally change how design teams operate in an AI-first world.

### Key Takeaways

## 3 highlights from my interview with Carl

**1 — Focus on hot paths, not pixel coverage**

Carl has completely rejected the standard approach of spreading design talent evenly across products. Instead of what he calls "peanut buttering efforts across the whole thing," he's obsessively focused on identifying and perfecting the handful of experiences that actually define a product. His reasoning: when AI makes everyone capable of 7/10 design work, companies win by having a few 10/10 experiences rather than consistent 8/10 everywhere.

> "I much prefer an experience where the things you do, you do effectively... I'm okay with an experience where certain things are just easy to do, but not much else. We made it possible, we didn't make it incredible. As long as some of the things that you keep coming back to have been perfected to a point that when you hold it, you know that it's quality software."

This creates what he calls the "hot paths"—the user journeys that leave an impression and make people want to return instead of building their own version. At Shopify, this means investing heavily in their design system (Polaris) so non-designers can handle the routine work, while concentrating their best designers on breakthrough experiences. It's the opposite of how most companies organize design teams, but it's specifically designed for a world where baseline design becomes commoditized.

---

**2 — Eliminate all abstraction layers in design reviews**

One of the most radical policies Carl has implemented is what I call his "no abstraction rule." Designers at Shopify are never allowed to bring presentations to meetings. No pre-reads, no decks, no context-setting. When reviewing work, they look directly at Figma files, prototypes, or live data in tools like Looker. His reasoning is brutally simple: users don't get the benefit of a pre-read, so internal teams shouldn't either.

> "No real customer is ever going to have the perfect circumstance where they got the pre-read right before and they fully understood the intent and all of the things. Like they get the messy reality of just being thrown into an interface and needing to figure it out and deal with it."

This forces designers to create work that speaks for itself without storytelling as a crutch. It's a complete reversal of typical design critique culture, which relies heavily on setting context and walking through rationale. But Carl believes this approach gets teams closer to the actual user experience and puts emphasis on the craft rather than the presentation skills. The policy only works because he's hiring designers confident enough in their craft to let the work stand alone.

---

**3 — Think ultra long-term and ultra short-term, avoid the medium**

Carl has a fascinating framework for how design teams should think about time horizons. He believes most product organizations get trapped in the "medium term"—that 6-12 month timeframe that's simultaneously too detailed for visionary thinking and too abstract for execution. Instead, he pushes his teams to focus exclusively on two extremes: ultra long-term vision and ultra short-term shipping.

> "It's actually somehow easier to imagine the world 20 years from now than it is to imagine the world two years from now. Because the trends become more about the macro than the specific things that are going to get us there."

For long-term thinking, designers imagine the ideal state without any constraints—what would commerce look like if we built it from scratch today? Only after that vision conversation do they work backward to identify what can ship in the next few weeks. This approach eliminates the weird hybrid of trying to balance macro vision with execution details that paralyzes most teams. It's particularly powerful for AI-era design because it forces teams to imagine truly native AI experiences rather than just adding AI features to existing interfaces.

### Ridd's Brain Dump

### 🎙️ Design Is Severely Undervalued—But It's the Key Differentiator

Carl believes that **design and designers are severely undervalued** in the market right now.

And actually, designers are the **second most valuable type of talent** in the entire market—outside of the foundational model researchers.

Because for the vast majority of the market, everybody is essentially outsourcing the job of model research to a handful of companies out in San Francisco.

So it's basically commoditized. We can't differentiate there.

So how *do* we differentiate?

---

### 🎙️ When Everyone Is a 7/10 Designer...

We're racing toward a world where **everyone is a 7 out of 10 designer**—because AI gives you a baseline set of capabilities.

In the same way that Carl says *he's a 7 out of 10 lawyer*, people will be able to vibe code apps that are "good enough."

So the question that SaaS companies will be asking themselves is:

> What do we make so that people want to keep coming back to our product and paying for it, versus vibe coding it themselves when software is free?
>

That's where **design comes in**.

And it's why Carl is obsessed with **pushing the craft**.

---

### 🎙️ Hot Paths Over Pixel Coverage

Carl is putting a **ton of emphasis on hot paths**.

He gets really opinionated about which parts of the product matter to invest in—and which parts are okay to leave at a 7 out of 10.

Instead of spreading the peanut butter evenly across the piece of bread, he wants to **concentrate design efforts on a smaller number of screens**.

---

### 🎙️ Design Systems for Scale—But Break the Rules When It Matters

To make this possible, he's investing heavily in the **design system**.

By having an incredible design system, **non-designers** can own the design of **non-hot-path screens**.

The quality of outputs with AI is only as good as the quality of the inputs—so he wants to make those inputs **world-class**.

But then for the hot paths, he's **hiring designers who are confident and skilled enough to draw outside of the lines.**

He doesn't want it to feel like assembling Legos—even if they're the most beautiful Legos in the world.

He wants people to get out the pencil, get out the scalpel, and **break the rules** to create something that stands out and is memorable.

---

### 🎙️ Lead with the Ideal State, Then Work Backward

Part of that is creating designs that don't try to one-shot scope or focus too much on constraints.

Carl wants designers to show up and **imagine what the future could be**—to paint a picture of the ideal state.

And *only after that* conversation is had do you start talking about what to work backwards from, to create something that you can ship in the next few weeks.

---

### 🎙️ Avoid the Medium Term—Think Long and Short

Carl thinks that as an industry, designers and product teams spend too much time **mocking up the medium term**.

He really only wants designers to focus on:

- the **ultra long term** (vision)
- and the **short term** (shippable work)

Ignore the medium term altogether—because it's the hardest to predict.

If you're thinking about **long-run scenarios**, you can ignore the low-level details and just articulate a North Star.

But when you're stuck in the medium term, it's a weird mix of macro vision and execution-level detail—and that's what makes it so hard to work with.

---

### 🎙️ Centralized Design Teams That Own Journeys

Another big point is how Carl is trying to **centralize the design team** at Shopify.

Not having people siloed into specific surface areas.

This relates back to the design systems philosophy—**not evenly spreading talent**, but instead concentrating it on **specific opportunities or full user journeys**.

He wants design to **own entire user journeys**, not static interfaces.

---

### 🎙️ The Molly Acquisition and Raising Talent Density

That's part of why Carl **acquired the design studio Molly**.

It's increasing the **talent density**, but it's also **ushering in a new working model**.

He really wants design to **lead the way inside Shopify**.

They're not staying comfortable.

They're relying on design to **completely reimagine commerce from first principles for an AI era**.

What are truly native AI experiences?

How do those interfaces change?

These are the kinds of **big, meaty questions** Carl and the design team are tasked with figuring out.

---

### 🎙️ No Abstraction: Work > Storytelling

Another idea: Carl doesn't let designers share **any context** for presentations.

He wants to **remove all abstraction layers** at every step of the process.

- No pre-reads.
- No decks.
- You're either looking at a **Figma file** or a **prototype**.
- Even if you're looking at data, it can't be in a slide—you have to go into **Looker** or the original data source.

Why?

> Because users don't get the benefit of a pre-read—and the team shouldn't either.
>

It puts more emphasis on the **work itself**, and **less emphasis on storytelling**, which is really interesting.

---

### 🎙️ Building Confidence Without Needing Business Justification

This ties back to Carl's belief that we should build up **design's internal confidence**.

Designers shouldn't feel like they *have* to justify every decision with a clean business impact statement.

It's okay for the **craft of a product to be incredible**—even if you can't draw a direct line between that investment and specific metrics.

He believes that **over the long haul**, this is how you differentiate your product in the market.

And that circles all the way back to his original point:

Design is undervalued—but it's the thing that can actually set a product apart when everything else is commoditized.
