#Ridd's Brain Dump

### 🎙️ From Engineering Bottlenecks to Strategic Burden

It used to be that the dominant reason why you wouldn't build something was because it took a long time to build, and we felt like we had very limited engineering resources, and we were always allocating them as the primary forcing function.

And that's still true, but it's definitely less true now that it feels like you can build a whole feature in a couple of days.

So now it feels like it's putting more of a burden on the strategy piece—but not just the strategy, but also the systems thinking piece.

Because the more features you add, the more complex the mental models become for your users.

So how can you ensure that you're not adding multiple concepts unnecessarily?

Feature bloat is okay sometimes.

Concept bloat can destroy a product.

### 🎙️ Blurred Roles and Taking Initiative

There's also an agency thing too where Andy saw an opportunity to move the needle with design, and he just simply picked it up—even though his title was growth engineer.

Nobody was expecting him to do design.

He just went for it and ended up making a massive impact on the product as a designer and playing a key role as a result.

And AI is blurring more of the roles within software teams where that same level of opportunity is being offered up to basically everyone.

If you see an opportunity to make an impact, you can just do it—even if it fits outside of your traditional box of responsibilities—because it's so much easier to move the needle in different ways.

Maybe that's tinkering with front end.

Maybe it's making animations for marketing.

Maybe it's even doing more writing.

### 🎙️ The Design Process Is No Longer Linear

There are way more versions of the design process than have ever been the case.

A few years ago, almost every time, I would have started spatially writing in Figma.

But now sometimes I just talk on a walk, and I turn that into a doc to send to the team to see what they think.

Or maybe I turn it into a PRD to one-shot a rough prototype in Lovable.

For every single project, you should give yourself a blank slate for what your design process should be.

And also, make sure to explore and tinker with new processes—just because it's the best way to learn.
