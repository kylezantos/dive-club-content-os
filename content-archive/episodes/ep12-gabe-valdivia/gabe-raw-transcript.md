Dive (00:00.212)
basic stuff of like how long you've been doing this, how many projects, maybe something about the type of projects, anything that you want to share for like the state of the world as an independent designer for Gabe and then maybe I'll just drill into like how the model works from there and we can kind of just see where it takes us.

Gabe (00:18.636)
Yeah. So the first time we talked was about a year and a half ago. And I had been doing this for six months and I've just crossed two years since I started working independently. thank you. Thank you. in that time I've, I actually today, I just closed our 20th client in two years. and it's been awesome. It's been super fun. in that time I worked with.

Dive (00:31.695)
Congrats.

Dive (00:42.287)
Nice.

Gabe (00:49.014)
Mostly early stage startups like seed or pre-seed companies, a couple later stage ones. But it's been great, like an awesome way to be exposed to a wide variety of clients, a wide variety of verticals. I worked on like healthcare clients. I worked on an insurance company. I worked on stuff that's more my bread and butter, which is consumer products, but also like

B2B products that I have usually stayed away from. I've designed many dashboards now. And really doing it. And yeah, it's been two years of really stretching myself creatively and learning a lot, like kind of the operations of running a business. And it's been like really, really great.

Dive (01:25.423)
Look at you.

Dive (01:42.031)
but you were still a little green at the six month mark. But now that you're at the two month, two year mark, you kind of figured some things out. So I want to drill into the model and get real specific for people who are interested in this potential career path. So maybe just starting simple in the beginning, 20 projects, two years, how are you juggling that? How much overlap is there? Can we just kind of drill into how your model works and go from there?

Gabe (02:08.93)
Yeah, so it's evolved a lot. So year two has looked very different than year one. Year one, I basically was trying to prove to myself that I could do this. So I was just taking in as much work as I could. And part of it was to prove it to myself. It was also because I was kind of creatively starved. I had a really large appetite to get my hands dirty and...

do design work after being in house for a long time. So I just took an old tour of projects and took them on myself. And around the end of year one, I started bringing in apprentices, which was a model that kind of like evolved as bringing in people that can help me with the design work. I can also help them by kind of coaching them and giving them mentorship.

so, you a little bit different than an intern, more like traditional apprentice model. And through that model, have kind of exposed myself to other designers and the larger community. And now I have over the last year, I've kind of honed this, kind of option two of how to engage with me where, you know, you can option one is engaging with me directly as a kind of design partner.

But this other option is deploying what I call a designer in residence within these companies. And I act as a design manager and coach for that designer. And then those designers interact directly with the client. So I've now done that for about a year. And it's been a really, I think, successful way of kind of satisfying the needs of those clients, kind of scaling myself a bit.

Dive (04:05.806)
It probably feels pretty good to invest in people too. Like that's not something that we get to do as often. And I've seen little things on LinkedIn, like you're bringing in like guest speakers almost for lack of a better word. Like talking a little bit about how you are investing in that group of people. What does that look like?

Gabe (04:15.979)
Yeah.

Gabe (04:22.165)
Yeah. So, you know, the, the idea is to provide people with what I found to be most valuable as I was growing up in design, which was, you know, being exposed to how more experienced designers work and thought. you know, a lot of that happened to me when I kind of graduated and worked at a legit company. I worked on a bunch of different smaller companies and I was kind of like inventing my own process, but it wasn't really until I

joined Facebook, then I was like, whoa, this is how the professionals do it. So I found that to be really revealing and helpful to me. So I think I've been trying to impart that in folks who may not have access to those folks and doing things like a speaker series where we have a private closed kind of interaction or Q &A with folks who've been doing this for a long time.

And we get to ask all sorts of questions. If they're hiring managers, we ask them, what do you look for? How much money should I make for my level at this company? How do pay bands work? All these very tactical things that you may not hear in a talk on YouTube or in a conference, you can have in this small space. And you get access to these people's decades of experience. So the idea is you come in as an apprentice.

And I treat you kind of like a peer. And I will give you feedback like I would have if we were both working on Facebook or you name the company. And I'll do that in a no bullshit way. It won't be a parental relationship. I will not sugarcoat the feedback. And that's part of the value. You will be expected to meet this quality bar.

And I found it to be really valuable growing up. And I think they find it valuable as well. And in exchange of that, then they can help with some design tasks that I need, like smaller things that come in my plate. And over time, these apprentices, most of them use that as a practice ground to grow their skills. Some of them show a lot of potential, and they grow a lot within that time. And they've been graduated to be part of my team.

Gabe (06:48.097)
where I can deploy them as designers in residence for other clients. So that's the idea. It's also selfishly a way for me to have somebody on Slack to say good morning to every day. Working independently can be very lonely. And I'm used to being part of a team. I'm used to mentoring people. And it's something that I missed after a year of working independently. So this is a way for me to create.

kind of environment where I can do that and kind of provide some value on the way.

Dive (07:22.358)
That's very cool. I hope a lot of people follow in your footsteps, honestly. Maybe we can keep going a little bit. So I want to just put year one and year two side by side. What are some of the other differences and ways that you've evolved the practice?

Gabe (07:37.611)
Yeah, I think the biggest change or how do put this?

Gabe (07:51.694)
The way that I've evolved my practice most meaningfully for me has been in how I define success. Coming into an independent work, the main anxiety you have is, I afford this? Can I find clients? Can I charge enough? Can I maintain my lifestyle with this new kind of way of working?

in a way that is unpredictable and unstable. I think that that fuels a lot of the anxiety for jumping into independent work. So as a result, for the first year, a lot of the way that I define success was based on money. And I was like, I need to make this much money because I need to survive. And once you hit that number, they're like, OK, I need to be successful. So I need to make as much money as I can.

And then what happened to me is that after year one, I looked at how much money I made and I was like really proud of myself. was like, wow, I made so much money. I, I feel like I've accomplished something and literally like, I'm not even exaggerating a second after thinking that my next thought was like, how do I make more money? And, and like, I didn't even savor it or enjoy it or nothing. Like I was, it was like anxiety that was replaced.

Dive (09:09.098)
Yeah, I bet. It's real.

Gabe (09:18.961)
more anxiety. Like, how do I take this to make more money? And I think luckily I caught myself in that loop. And I spent a lot of time thinking, how do I create the right set of incentives or dynamics so that I examine the success of my independent work in addition to making money, right? So that's not the only lever.

for success. So I focus a lot this year on identifying other ways of getting some sort of fulfillment for my work that are not tied to money, which is an infinite race. And it's been really rewarding. It's been a really kind of shift in how to approach a business. And I think I've hit another milestone in terms of how I enjoy this path, this new path.

Dive (10:16.901)
That resonates so deeply because I think I had a very similar experience where I detached myself from a salary and I wouldn't even call myself like a money motivated person but I do like keeping score you know I'm competitive and it's like the most quantifiably obvious thing to track like I'm not gonna like make excuses for people who are just

Gabe (10:30.071)
Yeah.

Dive (10:38.065)
shelling out their MRR screenshots on Twitter, but also I'm kind of like, you know what? I get it. You know, like you need something to strive for. That's like, we're human. That's what motivates us. So I'm actually curious what you have replaced that with.

Gabe (10:52.141)
Yeah, mean, it's such a alluring metric, especially because you don't have any notion of levels or any sort of reward of like, I'm getting better. The easiest way to look at it is like, made this much yesterday, tomorrow I make this much. So I found that to be a little toxic of like, got to stay away from that. So this year, I've...

Dive (11:01.202)
Exactly. Yeah.

Gabe (11:22.071)
put a lot more focus on, for example, this apprenticeship model of how many opportunities am I creating for other designers, which I find to be really rewarding. It sounds very altruistic, but it's actually quite selfish. I do enjoy providing opportunities for others. And there's been a handful of times where peers of mine are, they've been laid off, they're in between jobs, or they need help. And one, I've been able to hire them.

on my team and kind of help bridge their situation. And two, I've been able to find homes for them, permanent homes and different companies, which is, you know, I can very rewarding. Another one is like, how many clients am I working with that I, you know, that I actually am proud of that they exist in the world that I can align with their mission and can put my signature behind the work. That is not always the case for every client that you work with. So this year I've been able to

be more selective and kind of put in more of my stamp on the work that I'm doing.

How many founders am I enabling that I want them to be powerful in the world? Like a lot of, with a lot of success comes power. So a lot of that is like, you know, what is the character of the people that I'm working with? And do I want to like kind of propel them to be more and more powerful in the world? And does that align with the kind of world that I, that I wanted to exist? You know, how many of those are?

from underrepresented backgrounds or people of color or female founders? Am I creating opportunities for them as well and I'm making them more successful? So there's a few things that I've put on my radar of like, as I look back on the last year, yes, I made this much money, but also am I able to have these experiences along the way? Something else that happened last year is I had a second child.

Gabe (13:26.369)
So am I able to spend time with that child? Am I able to disconnect from work and spend the first months of their life with them? Am I able to enjoy the actual lifestyle of work? So I think that all kind of has, when you put it all in front of you, some of it weighs more than others. And I think it's a more healthier way of looking at success than just how much money did I make?

Dive (13:56.969)
Even something like having a kid introduces a ton of logistical challenges that I'm sure you had to figure out I want to get into all of those and go through a lot of the practical learnings and tactics but maybe we could start a little bit earlier in the journey and Speak to someone who maybe is on the fence or maybe early in this independent journey And I'd love to just hear from you about your beginning About your initial decision-making process like why did you decide to go independent?

Gabe (14:26.123)
Yeah. It happens actually when I had my first child. And, you know, when that happens, a lot of us, I think it's specifically dads, but probably not only dads, but I've met a lot of dads that, you know, as they're kind of supporting their partner as they're like, kind of like physically going through a transformation and delivering a child, like the magic that that is.

The dad is just there, you know, hanging out and witnessing that. And in that process, there's for me and for folks that I've talked to, there's a lot of introspection, a lot of like, you know, it can, it can turn into, kind of like spiraling in a bit. And, and I thought of, you know, having a kid is kind of like a 20 year project of like, you gotta be in this person's life for 20 years and make sure they're successful. So I, you know, that made me think like, what are the last 20 years? I mean, what have they looked like?

And are they any indication about how the next 20 years will look like? So for me, I did a lot of accounting of that time and how I felt about it. And I was lucky and privileged to go through some experiences that gave me some learnings. And I never really sat down to be like, here's my memoir of what I learned over the last 20 years. So that was a moment for me to take stock on that. So I kind of went a little crazy.

I wrote a notion document, literally, of a table of every single person I've ever worked with, like their name, the company, and the time, like hundreds of cells. And this, by the way, this happened on our baby moon, like when we're supposed to be relaxing. And I'm like, you know, my wife is asleep next to me, and I'm on my phone, like typing names of people I work with. Anyway, so I did all that, and it gave me this kind of

Dive (15:59.753)
my goodness.

Gabe (16:22.797)
renewed self-awareness of like, what is it that I enjoy? And, you know, the takeaway is that I, you know, I found myself oscillating between ICE roles and leadership roles throughout my career. You know, as an ICE, I felt constrained that, you know, there was, the scope of work was limited and I wanted to have more, more influence. And within an in-house environment, the only obvious way to, to achieve more influence is to scale yourself and become a

a part of the leadership team and grow a team and manage that team. So I went from, you know, from my seat to manager a few times and I found myself to be frustrated by those inevitably. So that was like, okay, so maybe I'm not a good fit for a company. I should start my own company. Like that's the other kind of like obvious path, right? So then you go in a spiral there and

What I learned is there's no problem that I feel so passionate about that I want to spend the next decade of my life working on. At least not yet. I haven't found one. But what I have found that I do love is that early stage moment, that beginning where it's a very vague definition of what you're working on. And it takes a couple of people in a room and a white board to figure out.

what it will be. That to me is why I fell in love with this. And throughout my career, those moments are the ones that I've enjoyed the most. Not the offsides, not even the shipping moments or growing the team or any of the accolades. The best moments have been like, okay, we have achieved some sort of breakthrough through just sheer design thinking, just getting into a room and pushing things forward.

Dive (18:19.173)
Mm-hmm.

Gabe (18:22.497)
So was like, what if I made a company that was focused only on that phase? And that phase isn't just a stepping stone to what eventually will become the company, but that is the company. And that kind of took shape into what I'm doing now, which is working specifically for other startups in that phase and helping them kind of get unstuck and unblocked to then go into further phases that they will find.

better partners to collaborate with in those phases. But I found that that is kind of my bread and butter. And as a result, what's happened is that I'm starting to develop a very concrete expertise. I came from the music background, right? And as a musician, you have one instrument that it's like your craft. And you join the band and you're like, I am a bassist and I'm a very good bassist.

And if you need a basis, look for me. And I am starting to fall into a similar thing here where I have a craft, which is, you know, it's not the legacy that I will leave for any given product that I work on, but it is like what I can contribute to that specific phase of a company. feel like I'm getting more and more confident that I'm pretty good at that. So if you're in that phase and you need a designer to help you.

kind of get unblocked, like I'm the guy for you. And I think it's like that amount of specificity does help me kind of like find a niche that I'm excited about.

Dive (20:02.894)
It's one thing to have that niche in mind as the ideal way that you want to work. And it's a totally other one to be able to effectively position yourself in the market, frame the right conversations, find the right people even. So talk to me about that bridge. Like, how did you go from, okay, I think this is the way that I want to work to now you've cemented yourself. Were you able to get there quickly? How'd you find the first few people? How did the initial conversations, were you even figuring out?

explain what I bring to the table and why I'm the right person for it. What was that part of the journey like?

Gabe (20:35.329)
Yeah, yeah. So maybe just one step higher from that. So it started from self-awareness that I mentioned. And what it uncovered to me is that I was a little discontent with my current state of things. I think if other people go through that same process and they are actually content, then there's nothing to fix. You're doing great. Keep going. But for me, it's like, how do I scratch that itch that's not being scratched right now?

So it kind of led me to the independent world. I heard, I don't know where I heard this from, but I heard that the rule of thumb is you have to make twice as much a year independently as you do in-house. I don't know who told me that or where I read that, but that's kind of like the rubric that I've been following. as a full-time employee who's been, I've been working for like,

15, 17 years at the time. Um, you know, that leads you to be pretty high up on the totem pole and you have a very comfortable salary. So to double that salary seemed really daunting. Like, don't, I don't know how to do that. Um, and luckily I have, because I've been doing this for a long time and because I haven't been, um, kind of a lone wolf, I just doing design work with my company, but I've actually in those 17 years I have. Taking, uh, you know,

been intentional of communicating what I'm working on with a broader audience. I've been on Twitter for a long time. I've been writing blog posts. I've been sharing my work throughout that time. And the result of that is that some people know either me or know my work, or they've read something that I wrote or something like that, or they've watched this podcast. And that has helped me kind of have more optionality to kind of

have leads essentially. the, way, the way it started is like, you know, again, because I've been doing this for 17 years, there was one person that I interviewed with three years prior who, you know, I didn't end up working with them, but they were, you know, I was on their radar. So I happened to be in this mindset of like, want to go independently and they, I don't know where reach out to me on Twitter and they're like, Hey, do you know any designers that are available for contract work?

Gabe (23:02.701)
And I was like, actually, I'm available. So that was the first seed of, let's try this out. And that was my first time negotiating a rate, figuring out how I work with people, writing a contract, figuring out I'm delivering what they're asking, and finding the right balance. At the time, I was working full time, and I did this on the side. So I had to juggle those two things.

So that was the first kind of experiment. And from there, I kind of reached out to other designer friends. they forwarded me some leads that they've gotten because they knew that I was interested in the contract world. So I went from one lead to a couple leads. And I had two contracts or three contracts. And my rule of thumb was, you know,

Once I have about three months worth of salary saved, then I can just quit my job and do this because it will take me about three months to find a job. Like I know that I've had so many jobs over the years that I know that the process usually takes for me about three months of like flirting with different companies, going through the interview process and then landing a job. So I gave myself like a three month runway and gave notice and...

Then I was like a free agent. So I kind of put in a call on Twitter and say, hey, I'm open to contract work. Here's kind of the types of companies that I want to work on and what I'm open to. If that's you or is that someone you know, let me know. Which takes a bit of a leap of faith to actually communicate to a community of strangers like, hey, I'm available. But luckily, I've been doing that for 17 years. So I had a network.

Dive (24:47.362)
Hmm.

Gabe (25:00.109)
that was paying attention and that led to a of a healthy lead network that I then started talking to and kind of have evolved to what it is now.

Dive (25:12.105)
just listening to you talk it definitely points to the value of social capital so I'm even making a mental note for myself. like man if you want to do the independent journey maybe even at some point in the future investing in that social capital and that network now is probably the single best thing that you could possibly do.

Gabe (25:29.377)
Yeah, mean, it's not, as I said aloud, I think it's not coincidence that I worked at Patreon for three years. And I really do believe in that format for creative work. And Patreon's a lot about creative independence and all these creatives who are usually within some sort of institution or structure, breaking free from that and having a direct connection with their audience. And through that,

direct connection comes a lot of freedom and optionality of where they can go creatively. So, you know, I spent three years really immersed in that product and that philosophy. And, you know, I think maybe subconsciously made me feel like, wait, I'm creative. You know, I am in an institution. Should I go independent? Which is no coincidence. A lot of Patreon employees end up making their own

kind of independent businesses. And I think, you know, there's obviously trade-offs there, but I think, you know, if that's kind of like what the itch that you're trying to scratch, there's a path available for you.

Dive (26:41.025)
How long did it take before you weren't semi-regularly having these immense doubts associated with like, am I actually gonna able to pull this off? Like, where was the line for you where you're like, I think I got this?

Gabe (26:55.885)
I think the doubt comes in different forms every so often. Initially, like I said, it's financial. Do I have a healthy enough set of inbound leads and projects to then to have make a living? And I actually, I vibe coded an app to keep track of this. And I've called it a freelance OS where

Dive (26:59.914)
Mm-hmm.

Gabe (27:24.555)
I made it just for myself. never released it with anyone and it's exactly what I need, exactly what I, what I love. And it helps me kind of understand, kind of project what the next few months of work would look like. Just to kind of, again, to appease that, anxiety and scratch that itch. Then the second anxiety comes in, you know, you give up the structure of a design org, which has built in within it, like a sense of competition and

mentorship and kind of you kind of understand where you rank with other designers and that helps you understand, am I getting better? Am I getting worse at my job? Going independently, you lose all that, or at least I did. So then the anxiety was like, am I doing the work? Am I actually moving the baton of design forward? Because the clients that I work with, they all love the work. They're like, this is great, amazing, 10 out of 10.

They don't know anything about design. That's why they hire me. So I need to be my own judge independent of what the clients are saying and form a rubric of like, how do I continue to get better? So that's a whole different set of anxieties and so on. Then it's like, what kind of product am I putting out into the world? Are those products that I would like to see? So I feel like every few months there's a new set of existential dread that comes.

that I need to kind of adjust based on that. And I think that's part of the beauty of being independent is that you have full control and agency of how you wanna shape your business. So you're not really at the winds of any PMs or VPs above you. So I've been able to adjust accordingly, but the anxiety hasn't quite left. It's just kind of like morphed into different versions of it.

Dive (29:17.344)
It works, okay. Let's talk about the business piece then. And I think anybody who's interested in going independent, one of the main burning questions is how the heck do I think about pricing? What has been your answer to that and how has it evolved over the last couple of years?

Gabe (29:36.514)
Yeah, my answer is no different than what other people have said. And in fact, it's based on what other people have said. You've had on this show who I call the godfather of freelance design, Kevin Juhi. think he's very good at this, and I've learned a lot from him. So my answers may sound familiar to him or people that know him. But the one rule, I know that one, you need to make twice as much

Dive (29:49.342)
Mr. Kevin, yeah.

Gabe (30:06.221)
independently as a full-time. I don't know if that's true, but that's what I heard. And number two, I know that above all, you cannot charge for your time. Somebody told me that, or I read that somewhere, which makes sense to me. Design is, one, is informed by, if I can do something in 10 minutes, it's because I've been doing it for 15 years. that's the result of all that. But also, you carry your work.

everywhere with you. Like when I'm showering, I'm thinking about my work. When I'm going on the bike ride, when I'm going to sleep, I'm like, I have like a breakthrough of like the design that I want to make. So, you know, are those billable hours? How do you really structure time for creative work? So why I knew is like, whatever your pricing is, shouldn't be tied to time. And, you know, I've, I've heard that before and I have people say that, and I've now worked with a lot of creatives over the last two years and they still charge for time.

They have a high number for their time, but they still do it. And I understand why, because the clients find that a very convenient way of structure the ROI. But I've tried every time to shift the perception or the understanding of value to not be based on our transaction or a time-based transaction, but more

outcome-based. And what we try to do is define what do we want to do as a partnership? What is the company or the product need? By when? So there is a time component to that. And define monthly or weekly or quarterly milestones. And then I manage my time accordingly to deliver that. Now, I think that's the key. You have to deliver on that.

I try to deliver ahead of time, where if we say this needs to be done in a month, I do it in three weeks. So that way, the client feels like they're always getting more than what they initially thought was possible. And once they're in that moment, they completely forget about time as a measure of ROI for their engagement. So anyway, charge based on outcome, not based on time.

Gabe (32:32.377)
and find a number that can feel arbitrary. Maybe what I've learned is that there is a client out there for every number, no matter how high or low it is. so in a way, the number that you have is kind of like, like an attraction to different types of clients. If your number is very high, you're going to attract clients that have a lot of funding, which happens to be clients are further along in the.

you know, companies life cycle. So you will be doing different kinds of work than if you're more flexible and then welcoming early stage companies. And in the other part is, you got to know your worth, which, you know, there's techniques that I've heard before that I think are true, which is, know, you have a number. If somebody says yes, too quickly to that number, then that number is too low. And if, if you increase that number until somebody starts saying no.

And then you're going to find that sweet spot. But the key is, who is that somebody? Are these people you want to work with? Or are the people are saying yes to the number? Or the projects that are saying yes to the number? Projects that you're interested in working with? So it's finding where you find that balance. So yeah, that's kind of what I've learned, which again, is nothing new. But it requires a lot of discipline to enforce it every time. Because the moment you make one concession,

then you justify that for the rest of your career. So I found that my approach is not for everyone. So some people may not be able to afford it or may not be able to, it doesn't match their expectations. So they don't know working with me. But a lot of the folks that I wanna work with end up finding a way to work together, regardless of that pricing model.

Dive (34:28.318)
You said a phrase shift perceptions. You were talking about it away from like you talked about shifting perceptions away from hourly. Do you also have to shift perceptions away from part time in general? Because know a lot of people are pretty dead set on know I need a full time person. Is that something that you have to combat? And what is the way that you are then selling yourself as fractional being the right strategic decision for that company?

Gabe (34:52.811)
Yeah, I think there's a, you can probably unpack what they mean by full time. know, part of that is obviously how much time you spend, how you're actually in the office or in Slack available X number of hours. think another part of it is more like culturally, they want to build a team. They want to feel a community in their, in their team. You know, I think there's a lot of ego tied into that where like, as a founder, you want to feel successful because you have this team that's growing and

That's a reflection of the success of your company. You we you talk to founders all the time. It's like, how are you doing? And they're like, great. We hired 30 people. And that statement alone is like a statement of success. doesn't matter what the third people are doing, whether they're working, whether they're being effective or not. It's just like their butts in seats. so, so I think there's a kind of built in expectation that like bringing people in is a measure of success and bringing in a contractor. It's like half.

success. So I think that's where the fractional framing comes in, where it's much lower stakes. You don't have all the surrounding benefits of being full time or all the logistics tied into it. You can be a lot more agile coming in and out as you need. And it becomes less about

your cultural impact in a company, which is valuable, but I would argue it shouldn't be the focus of the early stage. And it becomes more about, what do want to accomplish? It's much more outcomes oriented. So as a company, you have certain challenges that you have ahead of you. There's a few options of solving those challenges. You can bring in people, find them, bring them in, train them, and eventually have them solve those problems. Or you and I can work on this tomorrow.

and fix it in two days. So when you phrase things like that, you strip away any of the decoration, that makes a full-time hire and be much more laser focused on what the company needs at any given time. And of course, the companies that I work with, I end up working with them for a long time. I just wrapped up a contract for two years that I was working with them.

Gabe (37:19.693)
So you end up having a cultural impact anyway, but it's much more rooted on the actual output that you have as a team member than it is like this veil of just like a family.

Dive (37:37.468)
I'm gonna make you go way deeper here for a second. You might hate this question, but if I'm hypothetically a client right now, what are some of the key phrases that you would be looking to use in conversation to demonstrate what you bring to the table as a fractional designer versus what I might get elsewhere with your average run of the mill full-time designer?

Gabe (38:01.857)
Yeah. So your options as a founder, you have a couple of options. One, you can hire a full-time designer. And if you're an early stage company, one, you probably have no brand equity to attract talent. You probably don't have a lot of capital to bring in talent. know, these designers are making a million dollars a year, a meta. Why would they come work for you for a 10th of that money? And you you don't actually know

what they should be working on yet. Like the product doesn't have shape yet. You have a vague sense of the problem, but not of the solution. So you can hire a full-time person, which is challenging in its own way. You can hire an agency, which is very expensive and they have a very rigid process where like if you change the color of something that adds to the scope and now you have to like rejigger the contracts based on a single piece of feedback. So you have that stress of handling an agency.

Or you find the freelancer that it's much more contract or project based. They have, you know, work on a website where you work on this particular feature or this thing, which requires you as a founder to scope what that thing is and define it for them. So those are your options, which are all challenging. The option that I provide is I come in and you, it doesn't matter that you don't know what you need. We figure it out together. So we partner.

strategically on what the end result should be. And you can think of me as a design co-founder as a service, where I don't take co-founder equity. what I can contribute is at that altitude of figuring out what we're working on, and then using design as a way to articulate what we want to work on, and to understand this direction or that direction. That's kind what a design co-founder would do.

Dive (39:57.678)
Yeah. Do you use that phrase often, design co-founders of service? It's great.

Gabe (40:02.017)
Yeah, Soleil coined that, he used it to describe my work a long time ago. So I've used it since. So the idea is that you have a much lower stakes way of interacting with someone at that altitude without giving up that much equity or that long-term commitment.

Dive (40:05.38)
Man, everything always ties back to Suleyha, what the heck?

Gabe (40:30.721)
you're able to afford someone who's been doing this for a long time. And the difference is that from my perspective, I can't quit my job and work for a startup and work for a tenth of my salary. So I've been able to do this long enough that I can spend a fraction of my time working for that client and another fraction working with a different client and so on. And through that, I'm able to kind of meet the needs that I have that

typically a single employer would fulfill. I can now kind of spread it across different employers and or different clients. And that scratches my itch creatively that I get to work on different things. And for any given client, it satisfies what they need.

Dive (41:16.154)
Alright, so this entire model is predicated on your ability to operate at a high level across multiple different projects simultaneously. So let's talk about that piece of the puzzle right now. How do you fit these projects together? Are there any rules or safety rails that you put in place? How do you manage your time? What's that? How does that part of the practice work?

Gabe (41:36.952)
Yeah, I mean, in some ways it's no different than how a principal designer works at a large company. If you've worked in this long enough and you make it through the ranks and you become principal or director level IC, your role is to manage multiple projects and parachute into different projects to solve their needs. So it's not uncommon for those folks to have three or four different projects with different PMs and different strategies at once. So is that same model?

but applied to the startup sector. And the way that I've managed it is that clients have typically three phases they go through. The first phase is the most high intense phase where you're like really figuring out what is this product? What is the design system? What are the key screens? What is the brand look and feel? That's like that initial phase. The second phase is kind of that long tail where you're like,

really executing on that. So that's where you figure out things like setting screens and login flows and optimizing different iterations based on feedback. That's kind of that second phase where you have a foundation, but you're kind of like iterating on that. And the third phase is kind of where I hand off and I help the clients that I work with. I help them hire a design team, which most people don't have any understanding of like, what is a design org?

What are the different levels of a design org? How do I set up a culture so that it invites designers who are a very particular breed of knowledge workers? And how do I set them out to succeed? So that's what the third phase is about, which I've done a lot in my career, and I help set those companies up for success. So based on those three stages, they're usually demanding in different ways. So I try not to have two clients on phase one at the same time.

So I try to stagger them a bit where like I may be kind of in the trenches with with client one or client two. I'm kind of more like offboarding and helping them set something up and client three, am, you know, kind of iterating on features and that helps me kind of like, you know, contact switch and also have like the right energy for the right client.

Dive (43:53.945)
Where does your own business operations fit into this? I'm sure that there's quite a bit involved in there. You mentioned building your own custom tool. How do think about that?

Gabe (44:03.947)
Yeah, it can be very nimble, right? Like the operations of running a design business at one are very low. know, Figma and cursor subscriptions. And, you know, I think for me, I've added things like the apprenticeship model and the designer residence model, and that has a different pricing structure and obviously has

more complexity in communication because now I have to handle a team of designers and clients and that relationship. And I've been able to kind of create a process for that. Part of that process has been in creating my own tools through VypCoding. that is servicing the business, but also scratching my itch of learning new tools and understanding how to use AI to create new tools, which I'm

quite excited about. So through that, I've been able to create my own. I call them actually like software jigs. know, like in woodworking, you create a jig to solve a particular problem. I think by coding, it's a similar idea where like you want to do something, but the options are there are either too expensive or too bloated with other features that make a product into a company. Like in this case, I can just make the product that I need right now. It doesn't matter.

Dive (45:29.741)
Yeah.

Gabe (45:32.93)
What it looks like, it doesn't matter. It's monetization strategy. It just solves this problem that I need. So that's what I've done. I've built, like I said, budgeting kind of projection tool. I built my custom CRM that connects to my email. And these are all, you I have a user base of one. And it's great. Yeah.

Dive (45:53.686)
Yeah, but that's like your whole software stack though, you know? Like that's probably all you really need. That's cool.

Gabe (45:58.06)
Yeah, and I save like 40 bucks a month of subscriptions that it would be to use the alternative.

Dive (46:01.334)
yeah. And it probably works better because it's designed for you. I mean, I'm not a woodworker. don't really, the jig metaphor doesn't land on me as well as maybe some people listening, but I bet it feels awesome to make and use a thing that is bespoke for the very specific set of use cases that you have.

Gabe (46:17.503)
man, it feels so awesome. Like I said, I used to do music and a few years ago I made a record and I put it on Spotify and it has like yearly two listeners, me and my mom. But it's like, I think it's like the best music I ever made. It's exactly what I like. And I made it and I'm like, I love this so much. I listen to it all the time. And it doesn't matter then nobody else listens to it because it's like, know, scratching your own itch.

Dive (46:30.891)
Nice.

Dive (46:36.919)
I'm gonna find it and put it in the show notes.

Gabe (46:46.871)
So anyway, I've done that now with my business and it's been really helpful.

Dive (46:52.631)
You were actually maybe the very first designer who came to me with a vibe code project. It was two configs ago. I don't know if you remember this, but you were working on daylight and we were standing at the escalator and you're like, man, you were glowing. You were absolutely glowing. Cause you had just made Almanac, like the very first version. It was on your phone. You were clicking through and showing me. I was like, this is crazy.

He's not an engineer and he made a mobile app. And at the time it blew my mind. Now you release one of these almost every other weekend is what it feels like, but I will give you the credit. You were very early on the vibe coding train.

Gabe (47:32.334)
Thank you. It, I mean, still has that magic in me. Like, um, it's, uh, there's, it's something I actually, haven't yet used by coding tools for my work other than my own tools, but not for clients. Um, and it, I'm sure it's very great. And I have, I actually work with engineers who use cursor and they're like fucking hundred X engineers or they're incredible. Um, but I, I haven't figured out a way to fit into my, professional workflow.

So what I love about it is that I can make something that is totally devoid of a business model or a problem to be solved. And it's just an exploration of an idea. And it's the truest form of, here's an idea visualized or manifested, react to that idea by either using it or saying it sucks or whatever. And it's so pure and so fun. And it's like a brand new world where I'm, you know, I have

I know a little bit of code, but not enough to make an app. So I'm like in this total wonderland of like exploration and constant surprise and delight. It's really fun. I think it's evolving to be an essential tool in your tool set for a professional workflow. But I love that sliver of like, make some weird idea that you have and see it come to life.

If it's good enough, share it with other people and see what they think. Like that's so fun.

Dive (49:04.885)
Yeah. What's the friction for the professional side of things for you?

Gabe (49:11.243)
Gabe (49:14.657)
I think it's probably that I'm, I'm, I I'm pretty fast with how I work. So I don't feel like it will make me significantly faster. and there is something about maybe because the way that I've engaged with it is that a lot of the magic of Vive coding to me is like, well, isn't it cool that this exists? You know, which is, I think distracts from the question of should this exist, right? Which is like my entire job is to.

Dive (49:39.903)
Should it exist? Yeah. Yeah.

Gabe (49:44.48)
answer that question, should this exist? So the fact that I can design something quickly and then throw it away really quickly without any qualms about it, if the answer to that question is like, no, this shouldn't exist, I can throw it away, like literally just delete the frame and create a new one and there's no attachment to it. I think that that agility is core to the work that I do. And I feel like the Vive coding world.

would slow me down because it would add a little bit of attachment to the work, just by mere existence, by the mere fidelity of it all. Well, it works, and it's using real data, it used a real camera, and all this stuff, which I think is a different phase of prototyping. But at this point, I think I value the flexibility that comes with being a little bit scrappier.

Dive (50:38.877)
You talked about earlier how you feel yourself settling into the role of the standout bassist in the jazz band. What are some of the ways that over the last six, 12, 18 months, you feel like, yeah, I am growing in my craft at this specific set of skills that I bring to the table. What are those indicators or signals to you that you're still growing, even though you're not surrounded by

peers who are maybe directly pushing your craft forward.

Gabe (51:16.845)
Well, the indicator that I'm growing is that I'm working on projects that I find to be increasingly exciting. So the day-to-day work today is more fun than it was nine months ago or two years ago. So that to me, that's a good sign, right? And I'm a pretty harsh critic, especially of myself. So I can look at my work and be disappointed by it very, very quickly. And I do 99 % of the time.

so if I find that I'm like being challenged, that, that to me feels like a, indication of growth. and the set of, my specialty or what I have to bring to the table, I think that was in your question as well. is like, I mean, it's nothing unique. Like I don't have any, any secret sauce. Like I just, I think I love design more than most people. There's a lot of designers that I work with who.

I kind of begrudgingly designers who, you know, see it as a means to an end or they just don't like designing. And I love it. Like I, truly love it. And it's like the only thing that I've done other than music, like my whole life. Like I started doing design when I was 13 and I'm 38. So like, it's like, it's, it's, it's the only thing that I know how to do. but I do like it a lot. I think that what that allows me to do is I can do all the one.

It allows me to do the dirty work joyfully. Like I love naming layers. I love organizing shit. all that stuff that people frown upon or scoff at, I find it to be enjoyable. And that paired with something I think is more innate to my personality, which is I have like an extreme bias for action with like a very unhealthy degree of urgency.

Dive (53:00.734)
I love that.

Gabe (53:16.263)
so, you know, you, you deploy that to a startup and I think it's a pretty good fit. where, know, I, I'm usually that, accelerator in an environment where like, yeah, we need to do this. And I'm like, why don't we do this right now? In fact, I just did it and here it is. and that's the energy that you need in that environment. and I think a lot of people don't know that when they're in that environment. So they, when they encounter someone like me, they're like, pleasantly surprised and they, they see the, the, consequences of that.

kind of propelling the team forward. That combination is not a very good fit in later stages of a company. You have to be a lot more patient. You have to be a lot more thoughtful. And that has its own merit. And I think I can role play to somewhat be effective in that environment. But it does feel like a role play. The thing that's more kind of innate to someone like me is that combination of like, love.

the craft of design and I have an unhealthy attachment to urgency. So combining those two and I think that makes for a very useful contribution to the early stage environment.

Dive (54:28.372)
You also have this obsession with the total ambiguity, know? It's not even really a clear path forward. Which I do think is a really special thing to hear you talk about. And it reminds me of the tweet that I just remembered right now where you talked about how early stage design is kind of like, splunking a little bit.

Gabe (54:47.629)
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think the philosophy behind that is that I believe truly to my core that the best way to get through a good idea is through bad ideas. I think that's there's a little bit of humility in that where like, I don't think I have the skillset or the experience to be presented a problem and be like, here's what you need. See you in six months. Like some people might be able to do that, but I can't. What I can do is like

Here's one idea and then a day later he's two more ideas and then two hours later, he's another idea. And that exposure to ideas, I find it more exciting, more fun because that makes the job about encountering new ideas and rationalizing whether they're good or bad and applying critical thinking. And that job to me is much more exciting than setting up a plan for the next six months and just executing on the plan.

until you realize six months later that was the wrong plan. So yeah, I find myself attracted to that stage because intellectually I find it more stimulating, right? like being more creative, just like actually practicing creativity and using my hands or my fingers to like have dexterity in how I use a tool to create an artifact, but also how that artifact

interacts with people's worldview or even a view of their product and challenging that view. And that challenge, if you talk to anyone that knows me, they will say the first thing about me is that I love challenging people. I love improving things. So I think taking that and applying it in a professional context becomes really fun, where your job is just to make things better, like question everything and do so.

by painting a new reality that can feel tangible. And you could say that reality is not for me, but at least you get to experience it a little bit. And you get to kind of like put on those shoes for a little bit. And you're like, I'm living in a new world, even for half a second. You're like, that's not for me. Okay, well, then it's now my job to present a new world and go from there.

Dive (57:03.216)
Yeah. I love that because the stakeholder in that situation might not have been able to articulate that that wasn't for them until they saw it and had something to react to. And so you're helping clarify their thinking, even if it's just getting a better idea of what they don't like.

Gabe (57:18.251)
Yeah. And I think that's like, to me, that is quintessentially what design is. And right now we're at a point in the industry where like we're questioning roles and design. Like what is even design? And you can go from idea to product so quickly. So like, do you even need designers? Like, and my, my passion is not in like creating a product and nurturing that product to be as like culturally relevant, successful, you know, thing.

that ultimately leads to me cashing out and retiring. I think a lot of people are motivated by that. want like, you know, a flag to plant or like some sort of legacy of like, this is what I did. And it's important. I created an iPhone. created chat GPT, whatever, you know, like they want their iPhone or their chat GPT. I'm not motivated by that. think the thing that motivates me is that those breakthroughs of like applying a craft that is, you know, bigger than me. happened.

Like design existed before I came around. It will exist after I die. So I'm just tapping into a craft and a way of seeing the world. And I'm using that to operate in a creative critical thinking way to help people come up with different breakthroughs. And those breakthroughs is what kind of fuels me. It's not the one successful product.

Dive (58:42.354)
Hmm. Hmm.

I like that it's like a celebration of the process rather than the output, which is mostly rare.

Gabe (58:51.713)
Yeah, I I think that's what's at stake, right? Like a lot of people, I think, use design as a means to get to that artifact that is culturally relevant and it solves problems for people and builds a company and a legacy for them. And design is just kind of the stepping stone to getting there. I don't find that as exciting. I find the actual process of design to be much more rewarding than having

that final output that you get to point out and say, this is what I made and this is what I dedicated my life to. I'd rather dedicate my life to a practice, like a craft of design.

Dive (59:35.045)
Hmm. Well, you're the perfect person to have apprentices then. This is exactly the type of mentality that you need to learn from. We've a lot of ground. I kind of want to just zoom out and make sure that we've covered our bases here. So are there any other learnings or insights that you've gathered over the last couple of years that you think people listening who maybe are on the fence or earlier in their journey could learn or could benefit from?

Gabe (01:00:07.446)
Gabe (01:00:13.909)
Yeah, I mean, I think there's more nuance into the lifestyle of working independently versus in-house.

Like, you know, one thing that was evident to me very quickly is what comes with the stability of having a job from an employer, you know, that takes care of your needs, especially working in a big tech. It's like such a parental relationship, you know, like they do your laundry for you. They give you lunch and breakfast and you don't have to think about buying hardware because you can expense it.

and it is all these like components of living life that are taken care of for you. So I found myself, kind of floating through the human condition. You know, a lot of people experience, you know, challenges that because you have a cushy job and in big tech, you don't need to worry about that. And I think that creates a disconnect between you and.

the world around you, unless your world is San Francisco and everybody's experiencing that. But even then you have the rest of the world to interact with. And I think that dissonance was a little bit numbing for me, where I felt it felt it hard to just belong or find a place within the rest of society, really. And something becomes very obvious or evident to you.

the moment you kind of step away from that shelter and then you're bound to find your own insurance, you know, and interact with that challenge. Or, you know, I have a child, a second child coming in. How do I take parental leave? You know, what does that mean for my business? What does that mean for the livelihood of our family? I think a lot of that can sound like stress, you know, like you don't want to deal with that, have somebody else take care of that for you. But there is a lot of, think I find it really valuable to like,

Gabe (01:02:21.975)
be really confronted with that and coming up with a point of view of like, how do I participate in all these systems? All the way from like, how do you do your taxes? How do you set out vacations? Like, how do you send emails? Like, what is your voice as a business? How do you write contracts? All these questions are really meaningful, I think, for me to like encounter and come up with a point of view and like,

I never, I had never really thought about taxes. You know, and I was like, yeah, you got to do taxes. just, you know, talk to the accountant and they do it and keep going with my life. and maybe that's unique to me, but I felt really, sheltered. working for an employer, whoever it was to kind of fit it, like, like, give me, give me a place in life. And, know, there, there are other components to that of like, you kind of outsource your ego.

to these brands, you work at Meta and Meta has a brand. So if you work for them, you're automatically associated with that. There's good and bad to that. I got invited to a lot of conferences to speak just because I worked at Meta, which felt great for my ego. is this really a representation of myself? And it was really rewarding for me to speak at Config this year where I wasn't representing any company.

Dive (01:03:34.831)
Mm-hmm.

Gabe (01:03:48.824)
just the work that I was doing. you can argue that's external validation, which is inherently unhealthy, but it was more meaningful to work on something on your own and have that be recognized than to be attached to something else that takes care of you. And you have this weird transaction with them where you work for them, you provide some value to their company, they provide value to your life, and then...

Dive (01:03:50.617)
cool.

Gabe (01:04:17.005)
That's it. And then you retire and then you die. I think I found that to be numbing. It's a way of living that can lead to comfort. But for someone like me, it actually led to a lot of discomfort, a lot of uneasiness of what do I do? What do I do from here? So I think for people that are experiencing even a little bit on a drop of that, then

there's another path where you get to like shape where like who you are and how you interact with the other systems in the world. And it's challenging and, but it's possible. And I find it to be really rewarding.

Dive (01:05:00.314)
It's challenging but it's pretty exhilarating too. One last question. And I think I kind of just want to take a macro perspective to this because there's so much uncertainty in the world, specifically around our industry, the profession of being a designer. And I'm curious how you think about all of the shifting tectonic plates and how they impact the future of fractional design and the market for it.

And again, maybe speaking to that person who's kind of listening, but they're also trying to pick a path career-wise that gives them the best chance of thriving in a world where it's not as easy in many ways. So how do you think about where this is all headed and the role that fractional design plays in that future?

Gabe (01:05:52.354)
Yeah, I have a long winded answer. So maybe edit it as necessary. You know, one of the best people I work with is this guy named Charlie Sutton. He now leads design for Atlassian. Anyone that's worked with him loves that guy. I do too. And he's very, very much a mentor to me. And we work together.

Dive (01:05:57.548)
I got time and a good editor so you just dump my man.

Gabe (01:06:21.741)
and the VR team at Facebook in 2015. So it's very early on and we were like really drinking the cool air of VR and having like truly transformative experiences, VR experiences. I would, they're not called apps, they're like experiences that you consume or you interact with. And I was literally crying. I was like, wow, I've never been touched by this. There was one called notes and blindness that puts you in the shoes of a blind person and you.

experience the world as a blind person from the VR perspective. It's really, really powerful stuff. So that was all fueling our love for that field and our desire to, you know, leave our mark in that field. And there was a lot of pontification at that time. 2015, you know, I think VR is pretty hot and we're like in the future, we're all going to be plugged into a computer and it's going to be ready player one and, know,

We're going to socialize in digital environments and the metaverse and all this shit. Anyway, what Charlie said, which I still remember, know, he's a very, like everything he says is like informed by history in a way that sounds very convincing. Or it's very convincing, but, you know, I haven't read the history books, so I don't know if it's true. But he would say that when we're encountering these moments, you always think of like

It's going to change everything or it's not going to change anything at all. And both things end up being true. You know, for some people it changes everything for some people life continues as it is. So I think that's the framework that I've carried through when I'm encountering emerging technology. Uh, so AI it's of the moment and it's going to change everything. It already is right. Like I have a question about my child's health. I go to chat GPT and that has a very meaningful impact.

Dive (01:08:17.74)
Yeah. Yeah, thank God.

Gabe (01:08:20.141)
in life. Yeah. So it changes everything for a lot of people. At the same time, we're all people that have the same needs, have the same dynamics, and things are not changing as much. So you can argue that this is a moment like no other that we've experienced before. And this time, will actually do change everything for sure. But I think the more wise path is to kind of live

or accept both options as a reality. In fact, I read a book by Douglas Koshoff. Anyway, the book is called Team Human, and it talks about AI and what makes you human. And one of the points in that book is that the one characteristic that makes you human is the ability to have two opposing views and believe them.

at the same time. you know, there is no God and I have a purpose, right? People believe those two things like to their core. And that is what makes you human. That is what is really hard for a machine because machines are, you know, more binary, no pun intended. So anyway, I think when it comes to AI and what it does into how influences our industry is that I think it will do both, you know, like Yahoo.

is still like the sixth most visited website in the whole entire internet, you know, and, also you have crypto and AI and the whole world of, information that has soared past that. so I think both truths exist. So, you know, I think there are designers who design certain way today. think 30 years we'll be doing it the exact same way and they'll have a job doing so. And there are people who have an entirely different job in 30 years, probably.

I think specifically for fractional design, I think there is a very likelihood that AI will kind of like create an explosion in new ideas, kind of zero to one projects and provide a very viable solution to maintain projects. So I think we, I also think that we shifted from an environment where design was like this

Gabe (01:10:46.603)
discipline that will be tapped into for different phases of a project. There were agencies that you call in to redesign this thing or to provide some design thinking. And then they will go back to the design world, and the rest of the company will do their thing. And over the last 20 years, we kind of brought those people in-house, and then we created a role for them. And I think those roles are now becoming a little bit more

like replaceable and not as like necessary. So you have people with expertise like design who, you know, don't have a need to deploy all that expertise all the time in a single company. So the company only needs a portion of your expertise. And as an expert, you now have all these extra expertise that you can, that you have surplus, you need to figure out what to do with it. And I think that opens an opportunity to have, deploy to different companies.

which is what I found over the last two years that has been really successful. We talked about what my version of that is and how I'm able to be useful in different environments. I all the people have different expertise and will be able to deploy it across many different companies. And I actually think that the end result of that is more designers designing more and more companies. More companies that benefit from design, more products that are better designed rather than having

all this talent accumulated in a single company that may or may not be using that talent to its fullest extent. So for those who are experts in the field, who enjoy that field, I think it's a bright future because they're able to be freed up from the constraint of a kind of suitor for their expertise and instead apply it across different locations.

I think that's generally positive. Again, it comes to trade-offs. And it probably means that the way that a designer fits into an organization today will change in the future for some organizations, not for all. So I think it is forcing us as you know,

Gabe (01:13:07.341)
let's say creatives, not even professionals, but creatives, is forcing us to figure out like, what is it that we love? Do we love the idea of building a company or building a product? Do we love, you know, some other thing that we can define as design, or do we love something else that we become woodworkers or whatever? You know, there's this opportunity where you can take stock and decide what you like and see how that fits into the environment.

So I foresee that happening. And also, nothing will change for some people, and they will just do what they're doing today.

Dive (01:13:43.529)
Yeah, yeah, it's easy, especially when you hang out on Twitter, to underestimate the rest of the world when you just hang out in the little bubble. That being said, I do agree with the thesis at its core, where it feels like we're about to have this explosion of surface area that requires design, simply because the time to see an idea to something has just been compressed into this little sliver of what it was before. So

Gabe (01:14:13.547)
Yeah, I think that feels like design, but I don't know if that's design. It's a very efficient way to go from point A to point B, which is useful and valuable. But I don't know if that is the same usefulness and value that the design process brings into a company.

Dive (01:14:13.777)
It feels like a good time to be a fractional designer.

Dive (01:14:35.654)
You might argue that it doesn't, not only is it not quote unquote design, but it necessitates design.

Gabe (01:14:42.913)
Yeah, a version of it for sure.

Dive (01:14:44.009)
Yeah, a version of it. I'm going to draw a line here before we get way too nuanced. But Gabe, this was amazing as always. just it's so fun to hear your journey. I'm already anticipating the future check in. You have a permanent place on the show because it's just great to learn from all the things that are going on and the different adventures that you're the different projects that you're putting out into the world and everything that you're working on. So appreciate your time today.

Gabe (01:14:51.724)
You

Gabe (01:15:13.559)
Thank you, man. I love you and I love this show.

Dive (01:15:18.377)
Gabe, I love you
