### Description Hook

What does it take to go from "proving I can do this" mode to confidently positioning yourself as a "design co-founder as a service"? Gabe Valdivia just closed his 20th client after two years of independent practice, and his evolution from solo scrambler to someone who deploys designer-in-residence teams is one of the most methodical approaches to fractional design I've encountered. One of the most impressive things I've seen is how he's redefined success beyond the infinite money race—and built custom tools through vibe coding to manage it all.

### Description Highlights

- How he manages the 3-phase client model (and why you can't have two Phase 1 clients simultaneously)
- His apprenticeship speaker series giving junior designers tactical access to decades of experience
- The "design co-founder as a service" positioning that eliminates scope conversations entirely
- Why he charges based on outcome, never time (and the psychology behind delivering early)
- His custom-built "freelance OS" that tracks everything from budgets to pipeline projections
- The realization that happened literally seconds after hitting his first big income milestone
- a *lot* more

### Key Takeaways

## 3 highlights from my interview with Gabe

**1 — Success metrics beyond the infinite money race**

After year one, Gabe hit his financial targets and felt proud for exactly one second before his next thought was "how do I make more money?" This moment of catching himself in the anxiety loop led him to completely redefine success metrics for year two. Now he tracks: How many opportunities am I creating for other designers? How many clients am I working with that I'm actually proud exist in the world? How many founders am I enabling that I want to be powerful? Am I able to spend the first months of my second child's life with them?

> "The way that I define success was based on money... I was like, wow, I made so much money. I feel like I've accomplished something and literally like, I'm not even exaggerating a second after thinking that my next thought was like, how do I make more money? And I was like anxiety that was replaced more anxiety."

- Gabe Valdivia

This shift from purely financial metrics to multidimensional success indicators is what enabled him to move from survival mode to strategic growth—and probably what allows him to be more selective about the work that actually energizes him.

**2 — The "design co-founder as a service" positioning framework**

When selling fractional design, Gabe positions against three obvious alternatives that founders typically consider: hiring full-time (challenging for early stage), hiring an agency (expensive and rigid), or hiring a contractor (requires founders to scope everything). His alternative eliminates the biggest friction point entirely: "you don't even have to know what you need." He partners strategically to figure out the direction together, operating at the altitude of a design co-founder without the equity commitment or long-term overhead.

> "The option that I provide is I come in and you, it doesn't matter that you don't know what you need. We figure it out together. So we partner strategically on what the end result should be... you can think of me as a design co-founder as a service, where I don't take co-founder equity."

- Gabe Valdivia

This positioning completely reframes the conversation from "hire a designer to execute this thing" to "partner with someone who helps you figure out what this thing should even be"—which is exactly the early-stage ambiguity that Gabe thrives in.

**3 — Vibe coding custom business tools (and the woodworking jig philosophy)**

Rather than paying for bloated subscription tools, Gabe has built his entire business operations stack through vibe coding—what he calls "software jigs" inspired by woodworking. His custom freelance OS handles budgeting, pipeline projections, and client management with a user base of exactly one. The tools work perfectly because they're designed for his specific workflow, and he saves money while getting better functionality than off-the-shelf alternatives.

> "I call them actually like software jigs. I know, like in woodworking, you create a jig to solve a particular problem. I think by coding, it's a similar idea where like you want to do something, but the options are there are either too expensive or too bloated with other features that make a product into a company."

- Gabe Valdivia

This approach represents a broader shift toward independence—not just from employers, but from the entire ecosystem of business tools designed for generalized use cases. When you can build exactly what you need, you're not constrained by how others think your business should operate.
