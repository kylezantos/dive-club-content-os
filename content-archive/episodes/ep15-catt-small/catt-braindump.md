### 🎙️ Influence as Social Capital

Kat talks a lot about social capital and the currency of relationships—and that being a measuring stick for influence.

Like, how often are leaders asking for your opinion or asking for feedback or asking what you think we should do in a given situation?

And I remember having an off-site where the CEO of Maven asked me a strategic question—and in that moment realizing, *wow, I have some influence here.*

Being asked questions is maybe the best measuring stick.

### 🎙️ Building Relationships with Decision-Makers

So then it’s like: how do you get to that point?

What can you do—especially if the bulk of your relationships in an org are mostly at a peer level and you don’t have close relationships with key stakeholders?

Kat’s advice was to reach out to a leader that is close to your product or service area and ask for a **monthly one-on-one** just to hear their ideas, understand their goals, and make a point to say, *“How can I help?”* or *“Is there anything that I could do to assist?”*

And to start building that line of trust around your ideas.

### 🎙️ When Ideas Travel Without You

Another indicator of influence is that your ideas travel without you—that people reference your concepts in meetings that you didn’t attend.

Or someone might come to you and be like, *“Hey, I heard about your idea for X. Can you share a little more, or do you wanna jam on it? I also have some ideas.”*

If people are encountering your ideas without you having to be the one that presents them, then you know you have some kind of influence in an org.

### 🎙️ How to Make Your Ideas Travel

So I asked Kat about different ways to facilitate that.

One is this idea of **making your ideas memeable.**

A lot of that goes into storytelling best practices—and I could reference Ian Wharton’s episode because he goes into depth about that.

A very specific tactic that Kat used that I liked was recording an **async version of her vision presentation** and embedding that in a document with a little write-up.

Then she took that document and linked it in a bunch of other documents where she thought it might get visibility.

This ties to her interview with Kyle Turman, where he talked about the importance of **distributing your ideas**, not just making a good pitch and calling it a day.

### 🎙️ Pitching with Prototypes: The Benefits and the Risks

We also talked about the impact of AI prototyping tools and how a lot of designers are feeling pressure to show up with prototypes.

But there’s still a lot of merit in the fact that when you present an idea that’s high-fidelity and looks and feels real, people can get **distracted by lower-level details** while you're still trying to flesh out the concept.

That’s one of the reasons I’m really excited about using Inflight—because I often make multiple prototypes and lay them onto a spectrum of ideas.

And I can link my article about **pitching my ideas on a spectrum**.

Previously, that had to be mockups.

But now that it’s so much easier to make prototypes, it’s quite realistic for me to have **multiple prototypes** that I’m using to help people express where they would want to fall on a given strategic spectrum.

### 🎙️ Signaling Fidelity with Visual Cues

She also talked about a tactic that one of her colleagues used—adding a **slight blue overlay** on top of prototypes to indicate that this is not a finished state and you’re merely expressing an idea.
