    
    ### 🎯 OVERARCHING THEMES
    
    - Everything is **too long**.
    - **Character limits** are needed across formats.
    - Keep language **succinct**, **relatable**, and **clickable**.
    - Avoid **getting too specific** too quickly—broaden the hook before narrowing.
    - Highlights and subtitles should be **doorways**, not mini essays.

    ### 🏷️ TITLES (MAIN + ALTERNATES)
    
    **Main issues:**
    
    - Too verbose.
    - Too specific—makes it less broadly appealing.
    - Often lose curiosity or emotional punch.
    - Need to be usable as **YouTube thumbnails**, so require a character limit.
    
    **What to aim for:**
    
    - Short, intriguing.
    - Broader in appeal than just the subject’s niche.
    - Character limit for YouTube: **45 characters**.
    - It’s okay for alternate titles to be **subtly different**, not wildly unique.
    
    **Good examples:**
    
    - ✅ “How to thrive as an independent designer”
    - ✅ “The future belongs to fractional designers”
    - ✅ “Shopify’s big bet on design and craft”
    - ✅ “Crafting 10/10 experiences in the age of AI”
    - ✅ “How staff designers build influence as ICs”
    
    **Less effective examples:**
    
    - ❌ “Beyond the first 20: how to transition from scrambling freelancer to design cofounder as a service”
    - ❌ “How to architect your creative practice with two year survival data and apprentice leverage”
    - ❌ “The CDO who’s building designer confidence by breaking design systems”

    ### 📌 DESCRIPTION HOOKS
    
    **Main issues:**
    
    - Read like the first paragraph of an essay.
    - Often **too long** (reduce by **50%**).
    - Jump into **details too quickly**—loses hook value.
    
    **Fixes:**
    
    - Start with something **relatable** or **provocative**.
    - Then layer in the specifics.
    - Default to writing **half as much**.
    
    **Examples:**
    
    **Too narrow out of the gate:**
    
    - ❌ “What does it take to go from proving-I-can-do-this mode to confidently positioning yourself as a design cofounder as a service?”
    
    **Stronger reframe:**
    
    - ✅ “What does it take to thrive as an independent designer?”
    - ✅ “What does it take to successfully make the jump and build a thriving solo design practice?”
    
    **Escha example—current version:**
    
    - ❌ “What if I told you there’s a designer at Perplexity who doesn’t just create mockups? She generates 3D planets for onboarding flows, collaborates with music producers to craft browser soundtracks, and trains her own AI models to create thousands of unique invite cards.”
    
    **Better hook alternative:**
    
    - ✅ “Imagine joining Perplexity as a designer. On your very first day, you’re handed the keys to Comet and asked to design an AI-native browser from scratch.”

    ### 🔑 DESCRIPTION HIGHLIGHTS
    
    **Main issues:**
    
    - Too long.
    - Some cram multiple ideas into one sentence.
    - Many contain parentheticals or explanatory asides that dilute clarity.
    - Need to feel more like something *you* would say.
    
    **Preferred format:**
    
    - **One-liners**.
    - Clear, simple sentence structure.
    - No parentheticals.
    - Focus on curiosity and skimmability.
    
    **Good formatting base already in use**, just too verbose.
    
    **Examples:**
    
    **Too much:**
    
    - ❌ “Why designers are the second most valuable talent in tech (after AI researchers)”
    
    **Cleaner version:**
    
    - ✅ “Why designers are the second most valuable talent in tech”
    
    **Another fix:**
    
    - ❌ “Why distribution is the most important part of the process and her specific tactics for making vision stick across teams”
    
    **Instead:**
    
    - ✅ “Why distribution is the most important part of the process”
    - ✅ “How she makes vision stick across teams”

    ### 📨 NEWSLETTER TITLES + SUBTITLES
    
    **Newsletter titles:**
    
    - Generally **really good** already.
    - You’d like to see **three options per episode** to pick from.
    
    **Newsletter subtitles:**
    
    - **Too long**
    - **Not punchy or interesting enough**
    - Reduce to **~60% of current length**
    
    **What to do instead:**
    
    - Use one of the main takeaways as the subtitle
        
        **OR**
        
    - Write a **compelling summary of what the listener will get out of it**
    
    **Good examples:**
    
    - ✅ Title: *Measuring sticks* | Subtitle: *Strategies for building influence*
    - ✅ Title: *Human truth* | Subtitle: *An idea for using AI in research*

    ### 🗂️ HIGHLIGHTS / TAKEAWAYS STRUCTURE
    
    **Main issues:**
    
    - Paragraphs are hard to parse and don’t feel like your writing style.
    - Takes too much time to evaluate if they’re any good.
    - You want to **skim**, not read mini essays.
    
    **Proposed fix:**
    
    - **Initial output should be a bullet list** of the **key ideas inside each takeaway**, with **any quotes** clearly called out.
    - That way, you can say:
        - ✅ “Yes, this is a useful takeaway”
        - ❌ “No, this one isn’t that interesting”
    
    Once selected, the actual drafting of the full takeaway will happen **later in Claude**.
    
    **Key takeaway rule:**
    
    - You want **at least 4**, and up to **6**, takeaways per episode.
