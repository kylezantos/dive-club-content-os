## Template Library

### Title Templates

**Template 1: Curiosity Gap Generator**
```
Format: Future-State Positioning
Structure: [Entering/Beyond] + [Ordinal/Time] + [Context] + [Field/Domain]
Example: "Entering the 4th era of design tools"
Usage: When positioning emerging trends or technologies
Voice Elements: Specificity creates curiosity gap, implies insider knowledge
```

**Template 2: How-To Transformation**
```
Format: Process + Identity Change
Structure: "How to" + [Action] + "your" + [Identity/Role] + "with" + [Tool/Method]
Example: "How to build your ideas with AI"
Usage: Skills development content, strategic frequency use
Voice Elements: Practical framing, personal ownership, growth implication
```

**Template 3: Era/Generation Positioning**
```
Format: Historical Context + Future Implication
Structure: "[Ordinal] era/generation of" + [Technology/Field]
Example: "4th era of design tools"
Usage: Industry evolution content
Voice Elements: Historical authority, future-focused curiosity
```

**Template 4: Achievement Authority**
```
Format: Superlative + Personal Experience
Structure: "[Superlative] + [Achievement/Thing] + "I've" + [Personal Action] + [Time Period]"

Voice Elements: Transformation language, capability focus
```

### Hook Templates

**Template 1: Bold Personal Assessment**
```
Pattern: Strong Opening Statement + Authority Building
Structure: "If [strong claim]" → Personal credibility → Specific achievement
Voice Markers: Bold statements, first-person authority, concrete evidence
Examples: 
- "If this is one of the most impressive things I've seen a designer make all year..."
- "If you asked me 'who has the best taste in design right now?'"
- "If I had to pick the most practical design leader..."
```

**Template 2: Question-Based Engagement**
```
Pattern: Direct Question + Assumption Challenge
Structure: "[Question]?" → "Most people think..." → "But actually..."
Voice Markers: Direct engagement, assumption challenging, insider knowledge
Examples:
- "Did you know that the very first interface designer at Adobe..."
- "What does it take to create a product worthy of winning Mac app of the year?"
- "wtf is a prototype now??"
```

**Template 3: Probability + Assumption**
```
Pattern: Likelihood Statement + Personal Bet
Structure: "I'm willing to bet that you" + [Common experience] + [Specific reference]
Voice Markers: Conversational confidence, shared experience, specific knowledge
Examples:
- "I'm willing to bet that you have been on Smashing Magazine"
- "I'm willing to bet that you've used [specific tool/experience]"
```

**Template 4: Casual Disbelief + Discovery**
```
Pattern: Informal Expression + Surprise Discovery
Structure: "[Casual expression]" + "I had no idea" + [Specific discovery]
Voice Markers: Informal language, genuine surprise, specific learning
Examples:
- "Holy cow. I had no idea that..." 
- "Wtf. I had no idea that..."
```

### Description Framework

**Bullet Point Styles:**

1. **Behind-the-Scenes Approach**
   - Format: "Behind the scenes of [specific project/feature]"
   - Creates story anticipation and insider access feeling

2. **Specific Achievement Lists**
   - Format: "[Number] + [specific achievements/traits]"
   - Example: "The #1 trait of designers he's worked with over the last 3 decades"

3. **Process Documentation**
   - Format: "His approach to [specific process]"
   - Emphasizes tactical, learnable methods

4. **Tool/Method Revelation**
   - Format: "[Descriptor] + tool/method + for + [specific outcome]"
   - Example: "His new secret weapon software tool for storytelling"

**Curiosity Generators:**
- Number-based reveals ("3 types", "#1 trait", "first 10 prompts")
- Future predictions ("will exist", "where software creation is headed")
- Secret/hidden knowledge ("secret weapon", "behind the scenes")
- Contradiction setups ("won't use smartphones the same way")

**Credibility Builders:**
- Specific company positions ("VP of Product Experience at Duolingo")
- Historical significance ("very first interface designer at Adobe")
- Quantified achievements ("50,000+ lines of code as a designer")
- Industry recognition ("winning Mac app of the year")

### Newsletter Formula

**Subject Line Types:**

1. **Ambiguous-Intriguing**
   ```
   Pattern: Unexpected single word/phrase
   Examples: "red herring", "washi or doodle?"
   Purpose: Stand out in inbox, create curiosity gap
   ```

2. **Practical-Direct**
   ```
   Pattern: Tool/method name or clear benefit
   Examples: "How-to transformation", "tactical breakdown"
   Purpose: Clear value proposition for practical content
   ```

3. **Curiosity-Based**
   ```
   Pattern: Question or incomplete thought
   Examples: "wtf is a prototype now??", "Beyond Chat"
   Purpose: Create knowledge gap that compels opening
   ```

**Subtitle Strategy:**
- Must clearly state practical value
- Should complete the curiosity gap from subject line
- Creates "perfect one-two punch" with subject line

1. Apply curiosity gap formulas from templates
2. Include transformation/growth language when relevant
3. Use specific vs. generic terms ("4th era" vs. "new era")
4. Avoid hyperbolic clickbait while maintaining interest
5. Test against "*lot* more" casual emphasis style

**For Hooks (Editorial Standards):**
1. Start with question or bold statement
2. Build credibility within first 2 sentences

   - Is it practical and tactical vs. fluffy?
   - Does it create appropriate curiosity gaps?
   - Does it avoid clickbait while maintaining engagement?

3. **Audience Resonance Assessment**
   - Does it make readers feel smart and aspirational?
   - Is there clear transformation/growth messaging?
   - Would this stand out from generic content?
